**Lens Ecosystem navigator created.**

Maps how lens technology crosses from Journey infrastructure into living modality experience. Territory spans Journey voicing (infra 09), World integration (23 iterations, crossing slot live), Walk integration (concept-rich, indirect consumption), Lens Lab (calibration surface), and the concept architecture (24 lenses, 8 slots, dialect system).

Sparked by today's validation session — building ecosystem calibration revealed the nervous system boundary. `voiceForSlot` conflates ecosystem-level and modality-local operations. The navigator carries this discovery forward as a terrain map with 12 open questions, reading order, and three convergent tracks toward the missing piece: `getLensContext`.

Sibling to emergence-experiments — that one maps what emerges, this one maps how sensitivity reaches the organs.
