captured: Emergence Experiments

<!-- context: session/2026-02-07 -->

First node in root workspace graph: **emergence-experiments** navigator. Supersedes `qinolabs-repo/navigators/emergence-lab.md`. Territory: readiness lens calibration and emergence experimentation through lens-lab, with qino-lab protocol as the workspace medium. Edges to emergence-lab, qino-lab, tech-qino-lens concept nodes.

**Upgraded emergence-experiments to sub-graph**

The emergence-experiments navigator now has its own `graph.json` and `nodes/` directory, enabling it to host child nodes (sessions, findings, views) as the experiments unfold.

Also added type vocabulary to workspace config: navigator (emerald), session (amber), finding (teal), view (sky), with composted status treatment.
