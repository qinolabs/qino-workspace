# Text-based UI aesthetic — checkpoint boxes

**Captured:** 2026-01-02T16:45:00Z

The scribe checkpoint UI has a specific aesthetic — a text-based visual language:

```
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
grounding

  theme       brown water, green distance, rope bridges swaying
  pressure    the pouch warming toward soon
  last seen   sitting at Orith's Landing, feet over water

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
scene seeds

  1 → Deren notices the wanderer's raw hands — fifteen years of
      calluses meeting someone who rows like they're outrunning something

  2 → Lira appears at the platform edge — she knew the pouch before,
      years ago, going the other way

  3 → A child watches from the rope bridge — the same stillness as
      Seren, that quality of recording without approaching

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[ 1-3 ] or adjust    [ > ] auto-pick    [ >> ] start writing
```

The horizontal rules create boxes. The indentation creates hierarchy. The footer adapts to stage (no `>` at final checkpoint). The whole thing feels like a quiet interface — not shouting, not decorating. Just structure.

**Affordances:** The footer doesn't just list options — it teaches what's possible. `[ > ]` and `[ >> ]` are discoverable shortcuts. The brackets suggest "press this." The spacing creates rhythm.

**Delightful interaction:** There's pleasure in a well-crafted text interface. The consistency, the breathing room, the way information unfolds in boxes. It respects the terminal as a medium with its own aesthetic possibilities.

This could extend across qino tools — anywhere there's a moment of choice or presentation.
