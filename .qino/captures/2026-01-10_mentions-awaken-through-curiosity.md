# Mentions awaken into figures through curiosity

**Captured:** 2026-01-10T18:15:00Z

In chat, figures mention things of significance (locations, lifeforms, projects, people, events). These mentions could be color-highlighted in text and appear as cards to the right of the chat — not fully formed yet, just a shape with title and brief description. Image and detailed content deferred. If conversation around that mention deepens, an "unlock" button appears. Unlocking enriches the card (generates description, image) and adds it to Journey as a new figure.

The xenobiologist mentions "fractal networks" and "extremophile cultures from thermal vents" — these accumulate as ghostly cards. Ask about the thermal vents? That card awakens, becomes collectible. Organic ecosystem growth through genuine curiosity.

*Grounding conversation:*

> **Youthful xenobiologist:** "Just cataloging some preliminary microorganism samples from the station's outer research zones..."

> **User:** "i'm curious about life on the station, and what interesting projects we can collaborate on."

> **Xenobiologist:** "I'm tracking some fascinating extremophile cultures from the station's thermal vents — organisms that survive in conditions that would obliterate most known life forms. Would you be interested in seeing my initial scan data?"

> **User:** "yes, please go ahead"

> **Xenobiologist:** "Look at these — they're from a thermal vent near the station's cooling systems. See how they form these fractal networks? They're not just surviving, they're... communicating."

In this exchange, "thermal vents," "extremophile cultures," and "fractal networks" are significant mentions. They could become proto-figures — visible but unformed — until the user's curiosity gives them substance.
