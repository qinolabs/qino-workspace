# Context-Arc Terminology

**Captured:** 2026-01-21

> Ecosystem arcs express as `<context>-arc` in modalities. Not "quests" — that's game vocabulary that doesn't fit.

---

## The Pattern

Ecosystem-level arcs (attention, temporal, movement) don't appear *as arcs* inside modalities. They express through modality-specific forms.

**Previous language**: "Arcs manifest as quests in World"

**New language**: "Ecosystem arcs express as scenario-arcs in World"

---

## The Vocabulary

| Modality | Context-Arc Expression |
|----------|------------------------|
| World | scenario-arc |
| Walk | walk-arc |
| Chronicle | chapter-arc |
| Drops | session-arc |
| Journey | (holds the nesting itself) |

Each context-arc is **local** — bound to that modality's scope and language. The ecosystem arc is the pattern recognized *across* context-arcs.

---

## Why This Matters

**"Quest"** carries game baggage:
- Achievement framing
- Task completion
- Reward loops

**"Context-arc"** preserves the arc vocabulary:
- Same gesture at different scales
- Movement through, not task toward
- Shape recognized, not goal achieved

The relationship between ecosystem arc and context-arc is **expression**, not **translation to different vocabulary**.

## The Key Insight (Revised)

> **Ecosystem arcs express as context-arcs in modalities.** A scenario-arc is always world-specific. A walk-arc is always walk-specific. The ecosystem arc is the pattern recognized *across* these expressions — visible in Arc app, not inside any single modality.

## What Changes

- qino-world concept: replace "quest" terminology with "scenario-arc"
- attunement facet: same
- Any future modality concepts: use `<context>-arc` pattern
