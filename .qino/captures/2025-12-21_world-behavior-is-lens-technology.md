# World behavior is lens technology

"What the world DOES?" here in scribe is exactly the meaning of the qino-lens technology.

---

The question "What would the world DO if it felt this way?" — central to how qino-scribe translates git diffs into story — is a use case for qino-lens.

Scribe's world behavior step takes a quality (shape + texture from the diff) and finds where it wants to leak through across domains (material, spatial, temporal, creature, object, human background). This is lens work: quality → behavior across dimensions.

Today this is hand-crafted interpretation. Eventually it could be powered by lens technology — the same pattern-surfacing that finds semantic adjacency could find behavioral rhymes.

The wanderer's meta-perception — sensing something others don't — is how a lens user experiences pattern emergence. The reader sees clearly; the wanderer feels dimly. They share a bond over the pattern.
