# Trust ecosystem to carry conditions for meaning

Natural conversation has inherent pull and momentum - we don't need to construct or architect each individual response. Instead, we let the carefully crafted context be the vessel for the conversation to flow.

This is especially effective in qino-world and the qino ecosystem because everything is relationally charged. For example: The fact that the user chose this witness for the arrival is already information implicit in the system - it doesn't have to be made explicit.

Information is what's said and what's not said. The design of qino-world practices this in full. Every UI decision is made to keep the vitality - the "warm data" alive - because every interaction is "gesture" connecting to more than just rational thinking.

Trust the ecosystem to carry the conditions for meaning.
