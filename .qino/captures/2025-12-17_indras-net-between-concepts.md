# From wherever you approach the system

Since I've started exploring concepts I've noticed many moments where the membrane between one concept's aspect and another concept's primary tone becomes thin. From wherever you approach the system, every experience contains all the others. Communication comes effortlessly. The membrane grows thin — without dissolving into sameness.

there are connections on the ui level like this (non-comprehensive):
- from drops: enter walk or world
- from world: add cards for walk or drops
- from walk: add cards for world or drops

then there are connections on the core modality layer like this (non-comprehensive):
- qino world: generative negative space, getting rid of creative blockers
- qino world: communication that mitigates the fear of taking a wrong direction like qino-concept
- qino drops "room": second order story telling like qino-scribe and design-adventure
- qino drops "cadence": natural rhythm out of our control like walk
- qino walk: reframing or relational mapping from one context to another (eg. abstract context to physical) like qino-walk movement between centers
- discovery grid: "attunement" and taking away the inhibitors for exploration through constraint, like drops

... there's probably more.
and i will in time discover them.
why i think this is important:
apps consuming each other means we can explore how they integrate the whole and what residue remains after each movement from one to the next. if we know this. we will design our technical system differently. if we know this, we can see the nature of each app within each individual app.
