# Manifestation Needs and Offerings (Qino-World)

**Captured:** 2026-01-12

## Origin
- A world figure with a strong personality had little time to spare but still engaged.
- It felt like she had a place, needs, and a mission beyond the chat.

## Idea
- World manifestations have situational needs and are receptive to specific kinds of help.
- One might seek an object; another might need information.

## Cross-modality offerings
- Users could offer things they have *found* elsewhere in the qino ecosystem.
- "Finding" might happen in any modality (e.g., a special stone captured on a qino walk).
- The found object can become rare or meaningful inside a different world setting (e.g., sci‑fi).

## Crossing and meaning transfer
- Figures cross into worlds; objects can cross too.
- The key is that the object is meaningful to the user.
- Handing it to the manifestation makes the exchange meaningful in both contexts.
