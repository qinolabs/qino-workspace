# Scenario as Meaningful Progression (Qino-World)

**Captured:** 2026-01-12

## Premise
- A scenario isn't a static thing; it draws from a larger pool of scenario seeds.
- A scenario becomes meaningful through progression and shared history.

## How meaning forms
- Seeding is easy; meaning requires participation and impactful moments.
- Being present when something shifts gives the scenario weight.

## World-level progression
- Each stage has requirements that unlock the next phase.
- Fulfilling requirements may require leaving the world to explore other modalities and bring something back.

## Arc across modalities
- Arcs unfold over long periods and traverse the broader ecosystem.
- Progressing a world stage can open new locations or transform existing ones.

## Lasting change
- World events resolve, time passes, and shared history accumulates.
- Figures can be permanently changed based on who you engage with, what you bring, and what it means to you.
