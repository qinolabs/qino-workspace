# Rotating threads inform each other

**Captured:** 2026-01-07T15:30:00Z

I noticed: the way we carried three threads throughout this compare session (A, B, C) feels brilliant: the threads inform each other: if one doesn't prompt spontaneous action right away, i can move to the next, which might and then return to the earlier one. this feels like it should be explicit as design intention in cli-qino-compare. but be careful: assess if this might de-stabilize the intended system design.
