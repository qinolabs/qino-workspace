# qino-journal — Research Transmissions

**Captured:** 2025-12-29T11:30:00Z
**Source:** qino-world exploration → ecosystem language research → accessibility question

## The Impulse

How to make qino-research accessible — similarly to how qino-scribe creates chronicles published via qino-chronicles. What's the equivalent for research?

**Research transmissions** — periodic distillations of what's being explored, written in a voice that invites readers into the inquiry rather than reporting conclusions.

## The Avatar

A figure moving through research, as the wanderer moves through chronicles. A vehicle of trans-contextual continuity, helping translate so readers can connect their world to the research.

**Quality:** Where the wanderer has otherworldliness (larger than any single world), the journal avatar might have **pre-linguistic perception** — noticing things before there are words for them. Comfortable with productive uncertainty.

**Candidates for quality:**
- The one who follows threads — finds their way by noticing what's alive
- The one who asks — questions as mode of being
- The one who translates — carries meaning across boundaries
- The one who notices — perceives patterns before they have names

## Arcs

What shapes narrative movement in research:

- **Thread arcs** — question emerges → explored across entries → resolves or becomes held
- **Calibration arcs** — quality is vague → examples gathered → principles crystallize
- **Graduation arcs** — exploration matures → moves to concepts
- **Confluence arcs** — separate inquiries discover they're asking the same question
- **Divergence arcs** — one question opens into multiple threads
- **"Not knowing yet" arcs** — research stays uncertain, accumulates observations, doesn't resolve

---

## Connective Tissue

What carries across entries:

- **The avatar's evolving perception** — understanding develops (or productively confuses)
- **Threads as references** — named in one entry, picked up in later entries
- **The ecosystem as world** — explorations, calibrations, concepts become places
- **Language developing** — vocabulary emerges, reader acquires it alongside avatar
- **Cross-references as memory** — "As we noticed when exploring..." creates temporal depth

---

## Translation Work

The avatar helps translate research to reader-world.

The context of how research started (sourceRepo, moment of origin) becomes the bridge. "This started when we were building World and noticed..." — reader enters through concrete situation.

Questions asked as questions the reader can feel: not "how does ecosystem-modality tension work?" but "what happens when I try to build inside what's supposed to hold me?"

## Entry Anatomy (Sketch)

1. **Where we are** — what exploration/calibration/question is alive
2. **What the avatar notices** — inquiry rendered as perception, not report
3. **What emerges** — insights, new threads, refinements
4. **What carries forward** — threads to hold, questions to return to

---

## Arc Integration

Journal draws from research arcs (in `qino-research/arcs/`):

1. Query arcs by recency (most recent first)
2. Find arcs that haven't been transmitted
3. Use arc's narrative shape to structure transmission:
   - The **chain** becomes the avatar's path through the entry
   - The **essence** becomes the transmission's seed
   - The **threads opened** become what carries forward
4. Avatar moves through the arc's chain, helping readers connect their world to the inquiry

**Arc patterns inform transmission shape:**
- Confluence arcs → entries about unexpected connections
- Divergence arcs → entries about questions multiplying
- Recognition arcs → entries about suddenly seeing
- Crystallization arcs → entries about clarity emerging

## Open Threads

- The avatar's specific quality — what is their "otherworldliness"?
- Entry rhythm — how often? what triggers an entry?
- Relationship to research manifest — how does journal track what's been transmitted?
- The app — qino-journal as reader experience (like qino-chronicles)
- Backend — how transmissions are created and served
- Arc tracking — how to mark arcs as "transmitted" without polluting the arc file?
