# Figure-to-Chat as World Token Remix Bridge

**Captured:** 2026-01-11

The new "figure-to-chat" and "figure-to-chat-message" drag gestures in qino-world feel like a direct bridge to the **World Token Remix** pattern in the GMtool concept. Dropping a nearby figure onto a chat message remixes the message context through that figure's lens, producing a new prompt while preserving the original message. This is the same core move as "drag a token onto a scene/prompt/NPC to generate a remixed version while keeping the original."

Why this matters:
- It creates a tangible, gesture-based remix loop inside conversational UI.
- It turns relational context (figure + message) into a discoverable lens shift.
- It hints at a broader "token remix" grammar for chat: any contextual object can be remixed through a figure or token, producing a parallel thread rather than overwriting.

Open questions to explore later:
- How does this scale to multi-token layering (figure + world theme token + storyline)?
- What is the "side-by-side" comparison UI in chat (original message vs remixed prompt/response)?
- Should remixed outputs become their own tracked thread or remain inline?
