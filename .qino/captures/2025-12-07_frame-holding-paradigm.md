# Frame-holding as interface paradigm — who holds the frame changes what the interface is for

**Captured:** 2025-12-07T16:45:00Z

The grid isn't just an app — it's a pattern that can exist at different frame-holding levels.

Discovery Grid holds what GMtool asks the GM to hold — a stable frame. Where Discovery Grid's container is pre-set (pillars, gradient, bounded possibility), GMtool's container is the GM's ongoing authorship.

Both work with marked/held material that resurfaces, but the agency differs:
- Discovery Grid metabolizes threads on its own timeline while the user witnesses
- GMtool offers threads as raw material the GM consciously releases

The difference is who holds the frame. The GM is responsible for holding the space for the players, actively shaping what enters. In the grid, the outer frame is fixed — and that stability is the gift. You can turn inward because you're not also holding the container.

This suggests: interfaces can manifest at different frame-holding levels. The same pattern (marking, holding, resurfacing) means different things depending on who holds the frame.

In GMtool, a "session-pulse grid" could exist — pillars drawn from active storylines, the frame moving with the session's living state. The GM explores within the frame they're already holding, but the grid becomes a mirror for what's there.
