# qino-journey — cross-app companion holding wider context

**Captured:** 2026-01-02T12:00:00Z

I envision it as a floating bottom bar roughly one-fifth of the width of the screen, centered, rounded corners.

In any particular app or modality, the journey holds the wider context figures we've touched in other modalities and a temporal context as well. It enables the integrative movement between my current context on the screen and the wider context.

But it's more than a history of recent activity.

It's also a companion and a storyteller. You can engage in a voice chat with it. It can generate a spoken summary of what happened over the last 30 minutes or hour etc to give you a moment to step back and reflect.

What's crucial is that figures can be collected intentionally for them to be included in the recent journey.

For example I might read Qino journal and come across some philosophical idea that feels relevant to me. In the journal I don't directly interact with figures but with journey I could add it to journey so i can take it out again later when i'm in a different modality (like qino walk) to do something with it.
