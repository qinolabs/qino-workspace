# World Tokens — A Pattern Across Contexts

**Captured:** 2025-12-08T17:30:00Z

World tokens appear in multiple concepts, but each context frames them differently.

**In gm-tool:** Abstract aesthetic shorthand — *High Magic*, *Slow Decay*, *Dream Logic*. They enable reframing: drag a token onto a scene and the system offers a shifted version. The abstraction is intentional — tokens need to combine, mutate tone, work as lenses applied to any material.

**In qino-scribe:** Embodied presences — characters, locations, objects, weather. They crystallize what appeared in a chapter. The physicality is intentional — tokens should feel tangible, native to the world, things the wanderer would encounter.

**In qino-chronicles:** Rendered artifacts — the app interprets tokens visually (generates images, atmosphere) while preserving the scribe's exact text. The rendering is intentional — tokens become visual anchors for readers navigating the story.

The pattern: **tokens as compact carriers of essence** — but what they carry and how they're used shifts with purpose.

- gm-tool tokens enable *transformation* (apply to material, see it shift)
- scribe tokens enable *crystallization* (distill what happened into presence)
- chronicles tokens enable *navigation* (visual entry points into the world)

Same underlying idea, different embodiments. The abstraction level follows function.
