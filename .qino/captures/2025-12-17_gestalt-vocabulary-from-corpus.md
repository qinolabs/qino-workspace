# Gestalt vocabulary — words that name the system's nature

**Captured:** 2025-12-17T16:00:00Z

Reading across the orientation corpus, these words feel like they name something essential:

**Orientation field** — not documentation, not specification. A collection of partial views held together without being unified.

**Figures** — persistent forms that carry meaning through return, not definition. Cards, lenses, worlds, echoes. They can be re-entered and still feel like "the same thing" even as form changes.

**Gestures** — repeatable ways of acting that carry values before those values are named. Capturing resonance. Returning. Placing in relation. Letting things linger.

**Ecologies** — not hierarchies, not systems of control. Local coherence over global optimization. No central intelligence. Enabling conditions rather than mechanisms.

**Echo** — response that preserves a gesture while transforming it. Not feedback. Invites rather than explains.

**Fabric** — accumulation without narrative. Thickness, density, return. Threads that attract attention through persistence, not completion.

**Tensions held** — structure ↔ play, individual ↔ shared, explicit language ↔ tacit practice. Contradictions treated as meaningful rather than problems to resolve.

**Drift** — discomfort as signal. Deadness despite correctness. Over-explanation collapsing play.

**Return as vitality** — resurfacing without notification, reappearance without explanation. No streaks, no deadlines, no completion metrics.

**AI at the edges** — shaping voice, not authority. Translates between grammars. Surfaces resonance. Never decides meaning.

**Listening rather than control** — the system empty but responsive. Emergence noticed, not produced.
