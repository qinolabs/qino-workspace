# Release: Arcs as Soil, Figures as Seeds

## What release feels like

Release is the capacity to begin again but without pressure to do so. What moved has settled. What we learned has integrated. The possibility of re-entry kept safe.

## The soil-seed distinction

Arcs don't become new worlds. They become the *conditions* in which new worlds can grow.

- **Arcs form soil** — closed arcs compost. What was specific (names, places, events) dissolves. What was shape (patterns, tensions, movements) becomes fertile ground.
- **Figures form seeds** — figures with manifestations across different contexts (temporal, thematic, topical) cluster together. They hold potential for something new.
- **New worlds grow** — seeds planted in arc-soil unfold into scenarios. Not created through workflow, but recognized as ready to emerge.

## How this connects across modalities

**qino-drops** is the seed-recognition modality. Figures placed on the shore find resonance with each other. When something crystallizes — figures in arrangement that holds coherence — that's a seed becoming visible. "This wants to become a world."

**qino-world** receives what emerges. New worlds aren't created from nothing. They grow from figures that have been *worked* through ecosystem activity — walked with, dropped, conversed with. Each modality adds substrate.

**qino-arc** is where arcs manifest with shape, color, arrangement of items. If arcs are universal (work across all layers), then this view is a tuning fork — it resonates at whatever level you're at. Arc closure signals release. The shape completes, attention can move on.

**qino-journey** holds what persists. Figures carry substrate from closed arcs. Shapes travel, not details.

## The vocabulary gap this addresses

Strong language existed for accumulation and growth. What was missing:
- **Release** — the capacity to let go
- **Composting** — how closed material becomes conditions
- **Soil** — the fertile ground arcs create
- **Seed** — the clustering that holds potential

## What creates pull (why continuity naturally rewards)

Not "memory matters" abstractly. What actually creates pull:

- **Passages** — fresh without leaving. "Where can I go that's exciting without abandoning familiarity?" Temporal, spatial, cross-modality.
- **Arcs** — relate to you personally. Communicate what you care about without the weight of explaining. Agency through nurturing conditions, not labeling.
- **Figure trails** — the shape of your attention made tangible. Meaningful encounters and transformations across contexts, something to witness.
- **Leaving feels good** — because figures carry residue. Every encounter leaves an imprint. The departure is rich, not empty.

The pull to continue is intrinsic. The system doesn't need to reward continuity — continuity rewards itself.

## Multiple sources of "new"

The urge for discovery is real. But it shouldn't depend on seed-origin alone:

- **Passages** (temporal, spatial, cross-modality) — fresh without leaving
- **Awakening mentions** — new figures emerge from within through attention
- **Bringing figures from Journey** — fresh substrate enters familiar context
- **Starter decks** — always available, no conditions
- **Seed-origin from Drops** — one path among several, not the primary one

## Discovery context

Emerged through qino-world exploration: scenario discovery, decision points, "worlds emerge through interaction", when is too much, how does the new get in. The bias toward accumulation in the vocabulary became visible. Arc emerged as the release mechanism — the thing that completes and creates capacity to begin again.
