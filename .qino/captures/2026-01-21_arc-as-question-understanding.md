# Arc as Question — Understanding

**Captured:** 2026-01-21

> Arcs are questions you carry. Closure is conscious release when the question has done its work.

---

## The Core Reframe

**Previous understanding:** Attention arc = pattern you're following

**New understanding:** Attention arc = question you're carrying

The pattern is the *symptom*. The question is the arc.

You don't follow a pattern — you **carry a question**. The pattern emerges because the question sensitizes you. You notice thresholds because you're asking *what happens at thresholds*. The noticing is secondary; the question is primary.

## Three Arc Shapes (Participation Layer)

### 1. Temporal Arc
*The nesting structure*

- Structural — always present, automatic
- Nested: scenario-arc < world-arc < session-arc < user-arc
- Closes automatically when you leave the context
- Journey holds this structure

### 2. Attention Arc
*A question you carry*

- Personal — lives in you
- Named or implicit (can be recognized retrospectively)
- Spans modalities — the same question expressed through World, Walk, Drops
- Open-ended — may persist indefinitely
- Invokes lenses — the question shapes what you notice

### 3. Movement Arc
*A question that finishes its work*

- Emerges from attention arc when readiness becomes visible
- Closes through **conscious release** — your choice, not automatic
- At closure, composts into substrate (capacity, not content)

**Key relationship:** Movement arc is an attention arc that reaches conscious closure.

---

## Closure as Conscious Release

Closure isn't something that happens *to* you. It's something you **participate in**.

The system might surface readiness signals — recognition moments, integration, patterns completing. But the release is **your choice**.

### The Discernment Moment

When readiness becomes visible, you ask discernment questions like:

- "Am I ready to let this go?"
- "Does the question still serve me?"
- "Is the question ready to transform into something new?"

*(These are examples of the kind of question, not final formulations — subject to refinement.)*

### What Closure Is

Closure is **the question has done its work**.

What remains is capacity — the sensitivity developed, the facets invoked, the substrate enriched. Not what you learned, but what you *became* through asking.

### What Closure Is Not

- Completion (the question "done")
- Achievement (the question "won")
- Filing (the question "stored")
- Answer (a proposition that resolves)

Closure is softer: the question has done its work, what needed to move has moved, the shape is clear enough to release.

ATTENTION ARC (open, carried)
    │
    ├── expressed through modalities (scenario-arcs, walk-arcs, etc.)
    ├── invokes lenses (shapes what you notice)
    ├── accumulates (encounters, recognitions, learnings)

READINESS becomes visible

    ▼
DISCERNMENT (conscious)

    ├── Not yet → continues as attention arc

    └── Yes → MOVEMENT ARC completes

              CLOSURE (conscious release)

              COMPOSTING (residue becomes substrate)

## Inquiry Types as Categories

If attention arcs are questions, then inquiry types are **categories of questions**:

| Inquiry Type | Category of Questions |
|---|---|
| Sound-inquiry | Questions about sonic presence, what things sound like |
| World-building | Questions about place-making, narrative texture |
| (others to discover) | ... |

### Two Layers

The same category can exist at both layers:

**Participation layer:**
- User carries a personal question: "What does home sound like?"
- Belongs to sound-inquiry category implicitly
- May close through conscious release

**Practitioner layer:**
- Sound Lab hosts sound-inquiry formally
- Uses modalities as instruments
- Residue shapes ecosystem infrastructure

---

## The Lens Connection

If attention arc = question, and lenses = quality of attention:

- The question **invokes** the lens it needs
- "Why edges?" invokes edge-sensitivity
- The lens **serves** the inquiry
- Walk's facets, World's attunement — all serve the question you carry

**Lens-lab** calibrates the quality of questioning itself — not a category of questions, but a service for all questioning.

## Expression Through Modalities

Ecosystem arcs express as **context-arcs** in modalities:

| Ecosystem | Modality Expression |
|---|---|
| Attention arc (question) | scenario-arc, walk-arc, chapter-arc, etc. |
| The question you carry | Local form the question takes in this context |

You never see ecosystem arc language inside a modality. You see scenario-arcs in World, walk-arcs in Walk. The ecosystem arc is the pattern recognized *across* these — visible in Arc app.

---

## Arc App's Role

1. **Shows active questions** — what you're carrying
2. **Surfaces readiness signals** — recognition moments, integration
3. **Supports discernment** — helps you ask "is this ready?"
4. **Witnesses release** — marks arc as closed when you consciously release
5. **Holds the residue** — composted arcs visible as substrate

Arc app doesn't close arcs *for* you. The agency stays with the person.
