# Area visuals as hover background — figures take center stage

for qino-world: the scene view (the field): currently doesn't have much pull. the visualizations of the areas takes away from the pull that could possibly be found in the arrangment of figures. i believe we should treat the area visuals als background: literally: similarly to how the index pages of qino-journal and qino-chronicles show dynamic full-page image bg on hover of the respective item (chronicle / transmission), hovering an area could fade in the bg image spanning the entire canvas and gently shifting or tilting it in as my mouse moves across the area container.

this would free up the area node to show larger figure images and make the entire screen feel more conversational and interactive. not top-level but filled with possibilitis to explore the world through communication, encounters, inhabiting, simulating, and experimenting
