# Substrate leaks through visual adjacency

This connects to qino-drops: the adjacent "drops": meaning layer (user continuously sense-making through growing canvas, new adjacencies), substrate layer (the continuous, the data, the relationships without trying to make sense of them). In qino-drops both meet when changes in the substrate are reflected as changes in the drops appearance and the visual "influence" of one drop on another and this causes the user to perceive a difference that makes a difference and it informs the meaning- and sense-making since now the conditions have changed, and different adjacencies feel "stronger" than others.
