# Nearby Figure Whispers (Qino-World)

**Captured:** 2026-01-12

## Concept
- Nearby figures in the figure chat view feel alive even when not directly engaged.
- From time to time, they emit short "overheard" messages in a small popover bubble anchored to their floating figure avatar on the right edge.
- This creates ambient cross-pollination and keeps the main conversation fresh.

## Behavior
- A whisper bubble appears briefly (a few seconds) and then disappears.
- Clicking the figure replays the last whisper bubble.
- Clicking the bubble auto-submits a chat message to the current main figure, raising the overheard topic.

## Relationship mixing
- Overheard topics weave relationships between figures, nudging the main figure to respond to what other figures are experiencing.
- This supports mixing of themes across encounters without requiring the user to switch contexts.

## Continuity across manifestations
- Figures can change via new encounters in other modalities (linked world scenarios).
- A figure's whispers can be influenced by what their "future" manifestations experienced, letting insights leak back into the present view.
