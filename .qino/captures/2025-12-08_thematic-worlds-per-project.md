# Thematic worlds per project — genre as narrative lens

**Captured:** 2025-12-08T19:30:00Z

How could we integrate theme into the scribe? Each project that uses the scribe could set a rough theme (clear but not too constraining). When different chronicles are read by users different themes/eras/world settings (like world building genres and subgenres) could make the experience much more interesting.

The qino-chronicles app will present all chronicles on a dedicated web app and the wanderer is the continuity moving through them. There's potential for deepening the wanderer's persona (which will affect chapter generation) and allow for even more "abductive process" — the wanderer adapting across themed realms, persona deepening through genre shifts.
