# Modality boundaries and figure manifestations

**Captured:** 2026-01-11T00:00:00Z

UI design tension: unclear boundaries between modality-specific UI and ecosystem-level UI.

- Journey is an ecosystem concept with app-level manifestations, sometimes explicit, sometimes implicit.
- Example (implicit): qino-world “create world” view lists recent figures using ecosystem data, embedded in the local use case.
- Threshold screens are where figures cross from ecosystem scope into qino-world scope; in immersive crossings, this UX can stay consistent across the ecosystem.
- FigureCards and draft-style interactions live in the “meta-gaming” layer beyond any single modality.
- Inside a modality, figures should become local “manifestations” rather than a single shared component, so the aesthetic fits the app and preserves immersion.
- Scenario view likely needs Journey integration to pull new figures originating in other apps, but the UI should still honor the in-scenario context to avoid immersion break.

Framing: crossing is about the ecosystem’s figure system; in-world movement is about the modality’s manifestations.

## Seed

Put the seed in the ground now: the ecosystem needs a clear boundary language between “crossing” (shared, meta-gaming, ecosystem-facing) and “manifestation” (local, immersive, modality-shaped). This distinction is the root that can hold both consistency and aesthetic sovereignty without friction.

## Nurturing through qino-world (the conduit)

Use qino-world as the conduit to unfold the boundary in practice:

- Treat threshold screens as canonical crossing UX across the ecosystem.
- Let FigureCards live in the crossing layer; they signal movement between modalities.
- Once inside qino-world, figures re-embody as manifestations that fit world, area, and scenario language.
- Journey integration in scenario view should feel like a gentle ingress, not an ecosystem overlay.
- Let the scenario remain the guardian of immersion; the ecosystem should arrive as context, not interface.

Working principle: The conduit doesn’t collapse the boundary — it clarifies it.
