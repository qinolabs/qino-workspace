# Chat as contextual encounter

**Captured:** 2026-01-10T16:30:00Z

The chat experience should ground the user in who they're meeting. Left column reserves space for figure identity (avatar, name). Intro block shows origin and visual presence without repeating name. Conversation history context ("First meeting" vs "You've spoken 3 times · 2h ago") signals relationship continuity. Nearby figures appear as de-emphasized right-edge strip - peripheral awareness without distraction. Cross-session history would enable richer grounding: "Last met at the Observation Deck" and topic recall for conversation starters. The header shifts from world/scenario context to area-specific context during chat - you're not in Frontier Station, you're in the Engineering Bay speaking with Rix.
