# Embedding as Mutual Seeing

## The Noticing

The embedding question — which embedding travels to World, what text to embed — converged with qino-lens technology.

qino-lens says: "Looking outward is looking inward. The lens is never just about what's out there." The bidirectional gaze. Choosing how to see is also choosing how to be seen.

Applied to Journey's embedding design:

The embedding shouldn't just capture "the figure" or "my view of the figure." It should capture the **mutual seeing** — how the figure reveals the world, how the figure reveals you, how you reveal the figure, how you reveal yourself through encountering them.

## The Convergence

Option D (LLM-synthesized essence) + Option E (relational embedding) + qino-lens (mutual seeing) combine:

**The synthesis voice matters.** An LLM writing the essence makes interpretive choices. That voice could be a calibrated lens — Companion, Wanderer, etc.

**The Companion lens** is particularly resonant: "The world should be filtered through the relationship between characters who move through it together."

**The relational data is already there.** Encounters naturally contain relational language:
- "showed up while I was writing about boundaries" — what the figure reveals about you
- "she knew I was ready before I did" — what the figure sees in you
- "becoming a figure for knowing when to stop" — what you reveal about the figure

## The Implication

When a figure travels from Journey to World, they don't arrive as just themselves. They arrive as **figure-as-seen-through-you** — a lens that travels.

The embedding becomes mutual seeing encoded as vector.

Example synthesis using Companion lens:
> "Elena-and-you: A relationship at thresholds. She brings the wisdom of sacred incompleteness; you bring the attention that notices it. Through her, you're learning that limits are choices. Through you, her refusals become teachings rather than just absences. The gaze runs both ways."

World receives not a figure, but a relationship — a way of seeing that shapes what you'll notice in the new context.

## Connection to Identity

This extends the "identity as resonance pattern" note. Identity isn't just pattern persistence in the figure's trail. It's pattern persistence in the **mutual field** — the shape of seeing that keeps showing up between you and the figure.
