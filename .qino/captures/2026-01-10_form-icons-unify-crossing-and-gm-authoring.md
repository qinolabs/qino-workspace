World Tokens - A shared visual vocabulary connecting crossing flow, GM tools, and world rendering. Discovered during iteration 05 exploration: transformation form icons (companion, ship-tech, location, artifact, phenomenon, echo) should align with world entity types. This creates a unified iconographic language where the same tokens are used for: 1) Player crossing (choose how figures arrive), 2) GM authoring (place tokens in scenarios), 3) World rendering (figures appear as their token type). Key insight: don't block users at the gate with decisions - let them tap icons to switch forms instantly, discover meaning through in-world engagement.
