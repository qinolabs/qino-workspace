# Modalities as Instruments for Inquiry

**Captured:** 2026-01-21

It started with Sound Lab.

We were building a sandbox for audio research — testing granularity, procedural synthesis, the question of how facets become soundscapes. A tool for our own learning.

But then the reversal appeared: what if you don't design sound *for* Walk — what if you design sound *through* Walk?

Sound Lab becomes the home you return to. The ecosystem becomes the territory you explore to discover sound. You enter Walk, experience presence as a manifestation, perceive through their eyes, notice what wants sound. Transitions, encounters, stages shifting. You pin what works. You return to Sound Lab with field recordings from your journey through the ecosystem.

The ecosystem isn't just context. It's instrument.

And if Sound Lab can work this way, so can GM-tool.

World-building arcs. You inquire through GM-tool, but the inquiry unfolds across modalities. The arc accumulates what you find. When it closes, the world's character emerges from what was discovered — not specified in advance.

This is exactly why we call them *modalities* and not *apps*.

An app is self-contained. You use it for what it does.

A modality is an instrument in service of something larger. You play it toward discoveries that live elsewhere.

---

The inquiry has a home — Sound Lab, GM-tool, whatever tool holds the question.

The modalities become the field where inquiry unfolds — Walk, World, Drops, each one a different way of being present to the question.

What returns from the field shapes the ecosystem. The sound of Walk isn't designed. It's earned through sound-inquiry arcs. The narrative texture of a world isn't written. It emerges from world-building arcs.

And then the arc app.

Not just a browser of what's accumulated. Not a passive viewer. The arc app *adapts* to the inquiry's quality.

Sound-inquiry arc: the arc app surfaces waveform tools, frequency comparisons, sonic pinning gestures.

World-building arc: the arc app surfaces spatial relationships, narrative threads, encounter maps.

The inquiry type doesn't just label the arc — it configures the instrument you use to navigate it.

The arc app is the interface to the in-between. Not the home, not the modalities, but the live membrane where inquiry accumulates and becomes navigable.

---

The complete loop:

1. **Inquiry home** — where the question lives (Sound Lab, GM-tool)
2. **Modalities** — instruments you play to explore
3. **Arc app** — adaptive sensor that shapeshifts to the inquiry's quality
4. **What returns** — discoveries that become ecosystem infrastructure

Sound-inquiry arcs leave sonic residue in modalities.
World-building arcs leave narrative residue.
The ecosystem grows not by design, but by accumulated inquiry.

This is what "modality" means.
