# Journey interaction design for chronicles

**Captured:** 2026-01-02T14:45:00Z

## Presence

**Dormant**: Icon in navbar. Subtle badge when carrying figures (count or glow). No screen estate taken.

**Active**: Click icon → floating figures appear at screen edge. Close button (×) and Compose button adjacent.

**Empty**: Icon present, no indicator. Journey is available but quiet.

## Content Highlighting (when journey active)

Minimal actions on content:
- **Figure not collected**: Gentle glow. Tap to collect. That's it.
- **Figure already collected**: Recognition shimmer. No action needed.

No menus, no long-press options. Content stays readable. Journey just reveals what's there.

## Collecting

**Gesture**: Tap highlighted figure (when journey active) or long-press token card.

**Response**: Figure animates toward navbar icon. Icon pulses. Brief "Carried" feedback.

**What can be collected**: World tokens (characters, locations, objects, arcs), the wanderer, possibly chapter atmosphere.

## Side Panel (when active)

- Collected figures (small cards, scrollable)
- Close button (×)
- Compose button

Figures show: image, name. Hover/tap shows origin (chronicle, chapter).

## Compose Flow

**Trigger**: Click compose button in side panel.

**Dialog opens**:
1. Shows collected figures prominently
2. "Where should these go?"
3. Options: Walk / World / Meet
4. Select which figures to bring
5. Clear action to navigate to target app with figures pre-loaded

## Releasing

In side panel, figures can be released. Confirmation: "Release [name]?"

## Recognizing

When reading a chapter where a collected figure appears:
- Token card glows gently
- Entity in prose has recognition shimmer
- Journey contextualizes: "Here now" vs "From elsewhere"

## Returning

Journey remembers origin. Tapping figure offers: "Return to where you found this?"

## Summary

| Where | What | Action |
|-------|------|--------|
| Content | Not-collected figure | Tap → collect |
| Content | Collected figure | Visual recognition only |
| Side panel | Figures you carry | View, release |
| Side panel | Compose button | Opens dialog |
| Dialog | Combining flow | Select figures, choose destination |

Content stays minimal. Complexity lives in the journey panel and dialog.
