# Arcs as Lensed Accumulation

**Captured:** 2026-01-26

> Territory accumulates through the quality of attending. The arc isn't a container — it's a lens through which encounters become visible.

## The Starting Point

We began with a question: arcs exist conceptually but haven't been technically realized. qino-walk and qino-world have evolved significantly — how can their concrete needs inform what arcs actually are?

The investigation revealed that the apps need different things from arcs:

| App | What It Needs |
|-----|---------------|
| **Walk (Story-Walk)** | Narrative scaffold — setting, tension, tone, manifestations |
| **World** | Resonant awareness — register, pointer, something to color facets without overriding voice |

This tension was productive.

---

## The Insight: Arcs as Pointers

Arcs point. Territory accumulates. Thresholds determine what becomes possible.

```
arc emerges implicitly
    ↓
territory accumulates (encounters from World, Walk, wherever)
    ↓
thresholds become visible
    ↓
"enough here for a walk?"
"enough here for a world?"
"enough here to name?"
```

The arc doesn't need to *be* a type. It just *has* territory, and different apps have different thresholds for what they can do with that territory.

---

## Lensed Accumulation

If arcs accumulate territory **through** a lens (the quality of attending), then:

- Territory isn't neutral — it's already shaped by how you were noticing
- Two people encountering the same scenario accumulate different territory (different lenses)
- The same encounter can be visible through multiple lenses at different intensities

This shifts "register" from a committed dimension to something more like **the lens character of the arc**. The arc doesn't *have* a register setting — it *is* a particular way of attending, and territory accumulates in that shape.

### Facets as Queries

Instead of tracking lenses explicitly, they become **facets you can query**:

```typescript
arc.territory.facet("acoustic")   // what here has acoustic character?
arc.territory.facet("spatial")    // what here has spatial character?
arc.territory.facet("relational") // what here has relational character?
```

The territory holds everything. The lens is how you read it, not a phase marker.

Over time, different facets become denser. You can see attending shifts by examining facet density over time — without anyone having to mark "lens changed here."

---

## No "Wrong Arc"

If arcs emerge from attending, and attending is always multiple, then encounters naturally resonate with several inquiry threads simultaneously.

```
Encounter happens
    ↓
It resonates with arc A (acoustic)
It resonates with arc B (relational)
It doesn't resonate with arc C (visual)
    ↓
Linked to A and B
C doesn't see it (below threshold)
```

**The concept of "wrong arc" doesn't exist.** Arcs aren't containers you sort encounters into. They're lenses through which encounters become visible. The same encounter can be visible through multiple lenses.

---

## The Self-Reflection Moment

Instead of system-detected lens shifts (surveillance, presumptuous), we arrived at an **invitation to notice**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                 │
│  You've been here a while.                      │
│                                                 │
│  ○ Continue with [threshold acoustics]          │
│  ○ Release for now                              │
│  ○ Crossover to another arc                      │
│                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Three responses, each meaningful:

| Response | Meaning | What Happens |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| **Continue** | "Yes, still this inquiry" | Arc trail grows, attention confirmed |
| **Release** | "I'm not in focused inquiry right now" | Arc pauses, encounters go ambient |
| **Crossover** | "I'm in something else" | Spatial selection opens |

**Release** is important — it's not closure (the question hasn't done its work), it's just setting it down for now. You can pick it back up.

### User Response Teaches the System

The prompt isn't the system detecting a shift. It's an occasion for reflection. The user's response teaches the system:

- "Still same inquiry" → trail continues in current arc
- "Something new" → fork to different arc

The agency stays with the user, but the system creates the occasion for reflection.

---

## Spatial Arc Selection

When crossoverring, a spatial selection screen appears:

- Arc pointers floating on screen (not a list)
- **d3 force simulation** — arcs drift, settle, respond to proximity logic
- **Flat and minimal aesthetic** — monospace text in container with background color
- **Intensity influenced by relevance** — recently active, facet-similar arcs more present

### Proximity Logic

What makes an arc closer to center?

| Factor | Closer to Center |
|--------|------------------|
| Recency | Touched recently |
| Facet affinity | Similar character to current activity |
| Coherence | Strong internal pattern |
| User pull | Frequently returned to |

The spatial arrangement is the system's understanding of arc relationships made visible. You can disagree and choose an edge arc — that choice teaches the system.

---

## Thresholds Instead of Types

Instead of categorizing arcs (free, scenario-backed, etc.), we think about **what becomes possible** as territory accumulates:

| Threshold | What Opens Up |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Named** | Arc has a pointer you can refer to |
| **Walk-ready** | Enough territory for Soundscape-Walk |
| **World-ready** | Enough territory to seed a scenario |
| **Story-ready** | Scenario exists → Story-Walk possible |
| **Closeable** | Shape clear enough to consciously release |

These aren't types — they're states the same arc passes through. An arc might be walk-ready before it's world-ready. Or it might crystallize into a world and never be walked.

Apps query: "Is this arc walk-ready?" — not by checking a type flag, but by sensing territory density for the facet they need.

---

## Recognition at the Threshold

When choosing an arc before entering a modality, the arc needs to be recognizable. With lensed accumulation:

- **Pointer**: the semantic name ("threshold acoustics")
- **Facet character**: derived from territory (mostly acoustic? mixed spatial/relational?)
- **Recency**: last touched, recent encounters

```
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│ threshold acoustics              │
│ Mostly acoustic · 23 encounters  │
│ Last touched: 2 hours ago        │
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

The "mostly acoustic" is **derived**, not declared. You recognize the arc by its pointer and its character — which emerges from what you've accumulated.

---

## Trail of Lenses

Due to arcs having a temporal dimension, they hold a **trail of lenses** — the quality of attending at the beginning might transform into a different form later.

This trail is readable from territory:
- Early arc: acoustic facet is richest
- Middle arc: spatial facet grows
- Late arc: relational facet dominates

No explicit "lens changed here" marker needed — the shift is archaeological, visible in the territory strata.

---

## Implications for Walk and World

### Walk

Walk queries arc's territory for the facet it needs:

- **Soundscape-Walk**: "Is there enough acoustic territory?"
- **Story-Walk**: "Is there a scenario this arc points to?"

Walk doesn't need arc types — it needs thresholds.

### World

World sees the arc's inquiry face:

- **Pointer** for resonance (what is the user attending to?)
- **Facet character** for affordances (sound register → "Pin for Sound")
- **Recent territory** for continuity

World doesn't need narrative content from arcs — World creates narrative content. World needs resonant awareness.

---

## The Ambient Ground

If "release for now" sends encounters to ambient, there's a default ground:

- Encounters go there when no focused arc is active
- It's always accumulating
- Periodically, coherence might form — system could surface "something's forming in ambient"
- User can pull a thread out into a named arc, or leave it composting

This gives arcs a ground to emerge from, rather than requiring explicit creation.

---

## Summary

**Arcs are:**
- Implicit patterns of attending that become visible
- Lensed accumulation — territory seen through the quality of attending
- Pointers (nameable) with derived facet character
- Many-to-many with encounters (no "wrong arc")

**The self-reflection moment:**
- Gentle prompt after time/activity threshold
- Three options: continue, release, crossover
- Not surveillance — invitation to notice

**Arc selection:**
- Spatial arrangement (force simulation)
- Proximity influenced by relevance, recency, facet affinity
- Minimal aesthetic — monospace, bg color, intensity
- Selection foregrounds an arc; doesn't re-categorize encounters

**For apps:**
- Apps query arc's territory for the facet they need
- Thresholds determine what's possible (walk-ready, world-ready)
- No explicit arc types — just "is there enough here?"
