# Working directory as approach-from

**Captured:** 2025-12-19T14:30:00Z

In qino-claude's context-aware CLI tools, the terminal's working directory is analogous to modalities/apps in the qino ecosystem. But it's more than an entry point — it's the **approach-from**: the quality of how you relate to other contexts.

The working directory determines not just where you are, but the texture of how you engage with elsewhere. A note captured approach-from qino-claude (tools context) carries different weight than one captured approach-from an implementation repo.

The hyphen matters — it's one thing, not two. You don't "approach" and then "from." The from-ness is inseparable from the approach-ness.
