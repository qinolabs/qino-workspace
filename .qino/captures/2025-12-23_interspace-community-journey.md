Form and Content rhyme


Apps/modalities & Personal origin
Use one to tell about the other

From pen&paper Zettelbox to digital interfaces
WALK ... Distinction from podcasts (active/passive)

... old notes become figures, stepping into the cracks (in-between spaces)
LENS or DROPS to explore through dialogue with the reader's own world (allow figures that matter to them to enter the system and get in communication with the figures already inhabiting the space)

MEET to understand the nurturing soil, the substrate of my work.
My personal contexts to enter and experience the particular ecology of ideas from which the work emerged. Readers collect what resonates and store it in their avatar's backpack

Picking up "journey" bar.. sticky when scrolling down after coming back from MEET. JOURNEY already holds the contents of the backpack

What they collected can then be explored as Figures in WORLD added to qino provided decks. Shuffle the deck, start playing

Telling the story of the apps through the apps
Which reveals in what way the reader's own story is connected

Encourage interaction
Show their content as a deck of figures to be used in DROPS or WORLD or WALK and this is already contributng to the community.

Then explore community content decks

I design for connection and beauty

..
How to approach design?
- Gradual
- Drawn from experience

How to document?
- Multi-dimensional
- Spontaneous
- Implicit through the process

Experiments
- Public
- Multi-modal
- Interactive
- "Empty"

Simplicity, modular, accessible to others
Stories, language (levels), always personal


..
A map? (Of many stories & paths)
.. emerging from notes of noticing

Journey:
People & places
Collaborations & artifacts
Artistic expressions

The roots: warmth of friends & family
Throughout: personal growth

Relationship between the geographical & digital map
"What if the maps informed each other?"

And throughout all the experiments:
Begin noticing the deeper language
