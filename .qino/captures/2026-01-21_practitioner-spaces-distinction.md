# Practitioner Spaces Distinction

**Captured:** 2026-01-21

> The ecosystem has two kinds of spaces: where users participate, and where practitioners shape the conditions for participation.

---

## The Distinction

**Core Modalities** — where users encounter, collect, follow, cross
- qino-world
- qino-walk
- qino-drops
- qino-journey
- qino-arc
- qino-chronicles

**Practitioner Spaces** — where the ecosystem's infrastructure is shaped
- sound-lab (sonic character of modalities)
- gm-tool (narrative textures, world-building patterns)
- qino-frame (visual conditions, design system)
- lens-lab (ways of seeing, attention calibration)

## Two Layers of Ecosystem Growth

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         INFRASTRUCTURE LAYER                     │
│   (Practitioner Spaces)                          │
│   → shapes what modalities ARE                   │
│   → sonic character, visual language,            │
│     narrative textures, lens calibration         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                      ↓ conditions
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         PARTICIPATION LAYER                      │
│   (Core Modalities)                              │
│   → shapes YOUR ecosystem                        │
│   → encounters, figures, crossings, arcs         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Both layers grow the ecosystem, but differently:

| | Core Modalities | Practitioner Spaces |
|---|---|---|
| **Who uses** | Every user | Practitioners, designers, qinolabs |
| **What grows** | Your trail, your arcs, your substrate | The ecosystem's infrastructure |
| **Growth mechanism** | Participation | Inquiry-type arcs |
| **Residue becomes** | Your journey | What modalities *are* |

## Why This Matters

Approaching projects in the ecosystem requires knowing which layer they belong to.

**Core modality work**: Design for participation. The user's journey grows through use. Every encounter matters. The surface should invite engagement.

**Practitioner space work**: Design for inquiry. The findings shape infrastructure. Not every user will touch this — but every user will feel its effects. The surface should support sustained exploration and the accumulation of discoveries.

## The Inquiry-Type Arc Connection

Practitioner spaces are **inquiry homes** — where questions live. They use core modalities as instruments for exploration:

```
Inquiry Home          Uses As Instrument       Residue Shapes
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Sound Lab       →     Walk, World, Drops   →   sonic character
GM-tool         →     World                →   narrative textures
Lens-lab        →     all modalities       →   attention patterns
Frame           →     all modalities       →   visual conditions
```

The arc app adapts to inquiry type — surfacing waveform tools for sound-inquiry, spatial maps for world-building, etc.

## Open

- Are there other practitioner spaces we haven't identified?
- How do practitioners and users relate? Can a user become a practitioner?
- Does the arc app know when you're in a practitioner space vs core modality?
