# Drops as shore play — presence without seeking

**Captured:** 2025-12-18T02:30:00Z

From reMarkable

What differentiates a multi-modal content feed from what I envision with drops is the element of play / idle game.  not "synthesizing information" but something else… .. reminds me of walking through a landscape without looking for anything specific


Reminds me of
- iTunes interactive visualizer
- Train/Bus/Ship travel - movement without moving
- Samorost 3 card puzzle game (the mushrooms collector)
- Idle game: Room to simply be. Comfort of being submerged in the life-process with nothing that needs to be done
- Element of time as something optional, something I can choose as it fits me (eg. Pause/resume drops canvas, choose cadence)
- game: Harold halibut material design aesthetic, "energy waves you can touch", the abstract colorful, made tangible, nostalgic flair, retro computer aesthetic
- game: Wildermyth. Decision points: versions of self: allows for transmission of emotional state to game character decisions. Visual panels to inform decision

Time and sequence dancing and playing on top of the substrate

Figure row at top: visual indicators that link the drop to a figure/context in the row

The canvas:
Figure row on top, drops canvas below, drops of various height and width forming and appearing in a downward direction, drops don't move, there are drops columns that can be spanned based on the figure row.  on the left side of the canvas ("the shore") vertically/temporally aligned is the room.   The Deck (set of figures):
Contexts that glow bright that bring a story to life

Brings meaning to the action of adding a figure
Wall want to be seen and feel understood…
Discover ways how I can be understood by you through your story

In connection with the world as who we truly are

A social medium that isn't rooted in recapitulating
A way of sharing what it might feel like for you
A new sense for the possibilities when we soften our edges
Communication that feels alive

figures: charms that invite color and texture into presence

Levels
"Warmth": home, beauty, integrity, space - always there
"Ephemeral interactibles": to browse, to show, to play, to meet the movement, to collect


A day at the shore:
Describing a potential flow

See multiple cards - meaningful colocation
They have texture and color and are unique.
 together they welcome yesterday's journey into presence without expecting anything
- Shift of context:
 I received notification that one of my favorite video games will receive a sequel impulse and engagement  I notice that one of the cards I used yesterday is warmer than others as today's story is beginning to weave through it
- Catching a theme
 I enter some words in the text field at the top edge
 the ambient color and light shifting certain cards remaining on the screen

- A new beginning
 the shore is present and filled with life.
The theme is drawn like figures in the sand
cards in a row, ready to resume what never started

 the preselection reminds me of a story: a moment On the balcony with a friend in deep care and understanding

- A new context invites itself
 I enter some words into the search bar positioned in the top-left of the placeholder area as cards related to that topic wash ashore

 I recognize the one and drag the card towards the bar to insert or replace

- The frame is finding a balance with every action .. attuning
As my creativity and inspirations kick in I feel something that wants to reveal itself. Explore the space between the cards and set sail


- What's my attention cadence?
 I check in with myself: what am I focusing on?
 I set the cadence to five minutes and I pick up the guitar and practice a song  while the drops ambience is creating an atmosphere in my room

- Drops are forming
I notice what's branching and what's combining
curious where it's going to lead
 drops and room tiles beginning to take shape but not recognizable yet

- At end of cadence interval: drops materialize  and the virtual "room" is coming to life
spatial and temporal context mixing with the columns' cards' unique angles
I can lasso select clusters of drops that feel meaningful to me and it will gently affect their growth/evolution/communication
