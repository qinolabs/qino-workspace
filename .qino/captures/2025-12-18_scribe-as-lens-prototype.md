# qino-scribe as lens prototype — mutual seeing before the technology

**Captured:** 2025-12-18T00:05:00Z

qino-scribe is using the mutual seeing extensively in the relationship between the wanderer and the world.

qino-scribe is a prototype of sorts. it doesn't use the real lens technology yet, but might later evolve into something more technologically sophisticated that will bring forth the real lens technology as an interface that accepts different lens modules (different ways of weaving relationship across contexts or ecologies)
