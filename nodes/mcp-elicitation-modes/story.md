Claude Code supports two MCP elicitation modes that bypass the chat-only interaction constraint. **Form mode** renders JSON Schema forms inline in the terminal — dropdowns, checkboxes, text fields — for structured user input without free-text conversation. **URL mode** opens a browser URL, bridging CLI context to rich UI. Together they create a channel for structured decisions and UI handoffs that qino-claude skills and qinolabs-mcp tools don't yet leverage. Discovered while researching MCP Apps (which Claude Code does *not* support — Apps require an HTML rendering surface). The elicitation modes are the actual capability available today.
