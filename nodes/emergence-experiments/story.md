Discovering what emergence readiness means in the qino ecosystem — through running readiness lenses against accumulated substrate, calibrating until assessments produce genuine insight, and letting the practice itself reveal what matters.

**Territory**: readiness lens calibration + emergence mechanics + lens-lab infrastructure + qino-lab protocol as experiment medium

**Supersedes**: `qinolabs-repo/navigators/emergence-lab.md` (Sessions 1-3, 2026-01-31) — which traced the arc from emergence-lab concept → standalone app → architectural resolution (merge into lens-lab). That navigator mapped the territory and resolved the boundary question. This one picks up from there with instruments in hand.

**What changed since the old navigator**: The lens-lab integration is largely built (assessment pipeline, substrate workshop, fixtures, readiness lens editor). The qino-lab MCP protocol found its shape as a human-AI collaborative workspace. The standalone emergence-lab app served its purpose as scaffolding. The frontier is no longer building infrastructure — it's using the instruments to discover what readiness actually looks like in accumulated substrate.
