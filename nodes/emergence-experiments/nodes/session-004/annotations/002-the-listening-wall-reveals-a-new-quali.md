**The Listening Wall reveals a new quality: coherence that's architecturally present but experientially absent.** The wall sits at the world's convergence point, its substrate contains connections to every other scenario, and its physical position IS the world's principle made structure. But the four observers haven't spoken to each other, so the coherence can't be experienced.

This is a different state from the Full Market in the Convergence Basin (0.32), which genuinely contradicted the world's fabric. The Listening Wall doesn't contradict — it conceals. The coherence is there but submerged.

**This maps to a lifecycle state**: a scenario that has accumulated enough substrate (high saturation) and has real connections to the world (structural coherence) but hasn't achieved the inter-observer convergence that would make it visible. It's waiting for a *convergence event* between the four perspectives — the moment when Petra's minerals, Cael's acoustics, Moth's hidden archive, and the Foundation Stone's marks are seen as facets of the same thing.

The difference between "low coherence" and "latent coherence" may be important enough to warrant a distinction in the assessment output — perhaps a secondary signal or a flag.
