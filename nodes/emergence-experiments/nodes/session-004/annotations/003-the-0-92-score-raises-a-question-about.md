**The 0.92 score raises a question about signal range.** The Glassmaker's Reach scored 0.92 coherence — the highest signal across all experiments. But Hale's inquiry *explicitly names all three scenario locations*. In a real world, would any single manifestation ever have that kind of cross-scenario awareness? Or is this an artifact of fixture design — we gave Hale world-level knowledge to create a testable inter-scenario connection?

If the fixture is unrealistically connected, the calibration table is skewed. In real play, inter-scenario connections would be more subtle — a mineral that *looks similar* rather than a character stating the match outright. The coherence lens might need to detect implied connections (thematic resonance, material similarity) rather than relying on explicit cross-references.

**Implication**: the v1 coherence lens prompt may be over-sensitive to explicit mentions and under-sensitive to structural resonance. A v2 might need attention focus on implicit connections — materials that could be related, temporal coincidences, spatial proximity — not just what manifestations have stated.

**Resolved**: Session 5 addressed this directly. Audited all 10 Tidal Workshop inquiries, found 1 clear violation (Hale naming three locations) and 1 borderline case. Revised both to be experiential and local. Established the Storytelling Integrity Principle: characters have local knowledge only; the lens is the reader. Drafted coherence v2 with inference-over-matching attention focus. Re-assessed Glassmaker's Reach: 0.79 (down from 0.92). The 13-point drop confirms the inflation was fixture-driven, not lens-driven.
