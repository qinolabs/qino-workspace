**Coherence x Tidal Workshop — 3 assessments complete.**

| Scenario | Stage | Coherence |
|----------|-------|:---------:|
| Silt Garden | early | 0.75 |
| Glassmaker's Reach | converging | 0.92 |
| Listening Wall | saturated | 0.58 |

The world fixture performs better than the ad-hoc Convergence Basin. The designed inter-scenario threads surface in the assessments:
- Hale's tidal minerals inquiry explicitly names all three scenario locations
- Petra's "upriver masonry traditions" connects the Wall Builder to the Vanished Mentor
- Cael's "wall hears what's upstream" acoustically links the wall to the river scenarios
- The Changed Current in the Silt Garden matches world history's "river changed 3 years ago"

The Glassmaker's Reach scored 0.92 — the highest coherence signal across all experiments. Its emergence doesn't just fit the world; it *binds* the world together through Hale's cross-location mineral tracking.
