First emergence experiment: applying convergence and saturation lenses manually to all 5 fixture scenarios, producing structured assessments, then evaluating whether the lenses discriminate between emergence stages.

**Method**: Agent reads fixture substrate and applies lens attention focus to produce `{ signal, evidence, gaps, narrative }` — same output structure the LLM pipeline produces. This lets us reason about assessment quality in real time rather than treating the LLM as a black box.

**Question**: Do convergence and saturation signals form distinct profiles across the 5 stages? Does "The Full Market" (saturated-scattered) show high saturation but low convergence? Does "The Same Shore" (converging) show the opposite?
