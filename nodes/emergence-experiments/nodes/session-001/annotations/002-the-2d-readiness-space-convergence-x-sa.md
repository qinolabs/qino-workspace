The 2D readiness space (convergence x saturation) maps to the qino-lab annotation signal types. `connection` signals are convergence detectors — "these relate." The act of writing a `connection` annotation IS a micro-convergence assessment. The annotation signals aren't just metadata categories; they're manual readiness lenses applied at human scale.

This connects to Role 3 from the earlier exploration: qino-lab as self-applicable instrument. The workspace protocol already contains readiness-sensing machinery in its signal vocabulary.
