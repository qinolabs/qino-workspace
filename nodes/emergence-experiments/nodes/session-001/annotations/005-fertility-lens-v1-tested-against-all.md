**Fertility lens (v1) tested against all 5 fixtures.** The hypothesis holds — fertility fills the low-end discrimination gap.

Key result: The Gathering Threads jumps from 0.12/0.14 (convergence/saturation) to **0.58** on fertility. The Empty Room stays at 0.06. The lens detects the complementary voices (cartographer + crossroads keeper), the latent navigation theme (compass guild + waystone markers + northern signal), and the open tension — all qualities invisible to convergence and saturation.

Fertility also reveals something new about The Full Market (0.45) — hidden connection seeds (Night Market as cross-domain event, bell + clay materiality theme) exist beneath the scatter. The saturation lens saw mass; the fertility lens sees buried structure.

Fertility decreases as potential converts to actual: early (0.58) → converging (0.38) → near-ready (0.22). It measures potential energy that gets spent as emergence progresses.
