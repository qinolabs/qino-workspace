~~**Low-end insensitivity**~~ → **Resolved by fertility lens.**

Original tension: The Empty Room (0.03/0.04) and The Gathering Threads (0.12/0.14) were nearly indistinguishable — convergence and saturation couldn't discriminate between "nothing" and "something starting."

Resolution: The fertility lens fills this gap. The Gathering Threads scores 0.58 on fertility (vs 0.06 for The Empty Room) — it detects the complementary voices, latent navigation theme, and open tension that convergence and saturation are blind to. Convergence and saturation are confirmed as mid-to-late-stage instruments; fertility covers the early stage.
