Ran all 10 assessments (2 lenses x 5 fixtures). The convergence and saturation lenses produce orthogonal signals that discriminate between stages a single metric would conflate.

**Calibration table:**
| Fixture | Stage | Convergence | Saturation |
|---------|-------|:-----------:|:----------:|
| The Empty Room | cold | 0.03 | 0.04 |
| The Gathering Threads | early | 0.12 | 0.14 |
| The Same Shore | converging | 0.72 | 0.48 |
| The Full Market | saturated-scattered | 0.13 | 0.73 |
| The Threshold Garden | near-ready | 0.88 | 0.79 |

Key discrimination: converging (0.72/0.48) vs saturated-scattered (0.13/0.73) — direction without mass vs mass without direction. Near-ready requires both dimensions to be high.
