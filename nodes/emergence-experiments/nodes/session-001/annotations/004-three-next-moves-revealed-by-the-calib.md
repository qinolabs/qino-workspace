~~**Three next moves revealed by the calibration run**~~ — 2 of 3 completed.

1. **Run the same assessment via the LLM pipeline** — *still open*. Verify LLM signals match the calibration table. Requires starting lens-lab, seeding lenses, and running the pipeline end-to-end.

2. ~~**Author the coherence lens**~~ → **Done** (session-002). Drafted lens definition, designed `{{worldContext}}` input shape, ran against Convergence Basin test world. Key finding: coherence is world-relative and distinguishes productive tension from contradiction.

3. ~~**Test the fertility hypothesis**~~ → **Done** (session-001, later in same session). Fertility lens authored and calibrated. The Gathering Threads: 0.58 vs The Empty Room: 0.06. Hypothesis confirmed — fertility fills the low-end gap.
