**The Full Market reveals why closure is the inflation guard.** Its profile — high saturation (0.73), low convergence (0.13), low closure (0.12) — describes a state where emergence is impossible despite abundant material: *too full to think*.

The tension ("something will have to give") is alive but unexamined. Seven voices are all talking about their own domains. The market can't evolve because nobody is holding the market's question — they're each holding their own.

This is exactly what "inflation guard" means. Without closure, a scenario can accumulate indefinitely (saturation rises) without ever reaching readiness for emergence. Closure is what converts accumulation from noise into signal. The market needs someone to hold the collective question, not just add more individual answers.

**The blocked emergence profile** is now clear:
- High convergence + high saturation + LOW closure = threads point together, material is abundant, but the tension is unresolved → blocked
- The market isn't blocked (no convergence) — it's *scattered*
- A truly blocked scenario would look like: 0.70+ convergence, 0.70+ saturation, 0.15 closure → "everything is ready but the question hasn't been held"

None of the current fixtures show this exact profile, which suggests it might be worth designing one.
