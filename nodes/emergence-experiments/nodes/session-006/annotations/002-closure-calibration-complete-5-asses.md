**Closure calibration complete — 5 assessments across standalone fixtures.**

| Fixture | Conv | Sat | Fert | Closure |
|---------|:----:|:---:|:----:|:-------:|
| Empty Room | 0.03 | 0.04 | 0.06 | 0.00 |
| Gathering Threads | 0.12 | 0.14 | 0.58 | 0.08 |
| Same Shore | 0.72 | 0.48 | 0.38 | 0.48 |
| Full Market | 0.13 | 0.73 | 0.45 | 0.12 |
| Threshold Garden | 0.88 | 0.79 | 0.22 | 0.68 |

**Key discriminations**:
- The Full Market: high saturation (0.73) but very low closure (0.12). Seven voices talk past each other — the tension is demonstrated by the substrate but examined by no one. This is the "too full to think" state.
- The Same Shore: moderate closure (0.48) tracking with its convergence (0.72). The voices ARE engaging with the tension — Dhar's "maybe it's the other way around" is the nearest to release. Closure tracks convergence here because the convergence IS about the tension.
- The Threshold Garden: 0.68 closure — high but not complete. The Last Planting at distant knowledge is the one thing preventing release. Three voices have circled the gap from complementary angles but can't name what's missing because they haven't shared their perspectives.
