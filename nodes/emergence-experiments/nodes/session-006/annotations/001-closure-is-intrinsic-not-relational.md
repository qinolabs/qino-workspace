**Closure is intrinsic, not relational.** The substrate already contains what the lens needs: `currentTension` (the question being held) + `relationalInquiries` (the voices that have engaged with it). No world context or temporal history required.

This reclassifies the lens taxonomy:
- **Intrinsic**: convergence, saturation, fertility, closure — operate on scenario substrate alone
- **Relational**: coherence, proximity — need context beyond the scenario

4 intrinsic, 2 relational. Simpler pipeline than expected — only coherence and proximity need `{{worldContext}}`.
