**Coherence calibration against "The Convergence Basin" world** — 4 assessments complete.

| Fixture | Conv | Sat | Fert | Coher |
|---------|:----:|:---:|:----:|:-----:|
| Gathering Threads | 0.12 | 0.14 | 0.58 | 0.65 |
| Same Shore | 0.72 | 0.48 | 0.38 | 0.82 |
| Full Market | 0.13 | 0.73 | 0.45 | 0.32 |
| Threshold Garden | 0.88 | 0.79 | 0.22 | 0.78 |

Coherence discriminates differently from the other lenses. The Full Market — which scores highest on saturation (0.73) — scores lowest on coherence (0.32) because its scatter contradicts the world's convergence fabric. Meanwhile, The Gathering Threads — low on convergence and saturation — scores moderately high on coherence (0.65) because its tonal quality fits the world even before concrete connections form.

This confirms: **coherence is not derivable from the other three lenses**. A scenario can be saturated but incoherent, or thin but tonally aligned.
