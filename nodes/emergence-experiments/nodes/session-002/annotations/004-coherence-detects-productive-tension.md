**Coherence detects productive tension, not just alignment.** The Threshold Garden scored 0.78 (not 0.95) because its walled enclosure introduces a question the world hasn't answered: is convergence natural or designed? The other scenarios show convergence as something that happens (tides, crossroads, rumors flowing). The garden shows convergence as something someone *composed*.

This tension is productive — it enriches the world by adding a new dimension. The coherence lens distinguished this from the Full Market's dissonance (0.32), where scatter actively contradicts the fabric.

**The spectrum**: contradiction (low) → productive tension (moderate-high) → pure alignment (high). A world where every scenario purely aligns would be boring. Some productive tension is healthy. The coherence lens surfaces *where* the tension lives, which is more valuable than a binary fit/doesn't-fit.
