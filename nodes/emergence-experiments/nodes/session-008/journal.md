**Session 8 core finding: the full consumption chain.**

Traced Hale ↔ Cael (proximity 0.78) through the crossing facet. Discovered that crossing is not constrained by lens readings — crossing IS lens readings consuming each other at the relational scale.

The chain: proximity → intrinsic profile → coherence → closure → witness selection → crossing character. Each layer metabolizes the previous. No individual reading determines the outcome.

Key discoveries:
- **Crossing is asymmetric**: same pair, same proximity, different receiving profiles → fundamentally different crossings
- **The NPC witness is a lens function**: "voice before face" is literally the lens reading arriving before the entity
- **Closure is absorption capacity**: gates witness quality vs arrival's room to reshape (0.05–0.50 is the live zone)
- **Witness choice is a lens selection**: same scenario, different witness → different crossing character
- **The consumption chain**: compositionality made concrete — what lens-interiority described abstractly, crossing reveals as a world event

Proposal: transformation service could receive scenario lens profile as context (not constraint). Tension: over-determination risks killing surprise.

**What remains alive**: How does the scenario's profile change AFTER a crossing? If Hale arrives at the Listening Wall and catalyzes convergence, the next lens reading should show it. The crossing consumes the profile and produces a new one — the metabolism continues.
