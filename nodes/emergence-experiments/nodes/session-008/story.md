The lenses assess readiness. Crossing is what happens when readiness is acted on. This session traces the line from lens output to crossing design — specifically, how the full 6-lens profile of a scenario constrains what kind of crossing it can absorb.

Test case: Hale ↔ Cael (latent proximity 0.78). Neither knows the other exists. The river carries Hale's frequencies to Cael's wall. The proximity lens says they're ready. But ready for WHAT? Where does the crossing happen? Who witnesses? What does the scenario profile permit?

The crossing facet (concepts-repo/concepts/qino-world/facets/crossing.md) describes the mechanics: conversation as receiving medium, the witness pattern, voice before face. This session tests whether the lens calibration data can inform those mechanics concretely.
