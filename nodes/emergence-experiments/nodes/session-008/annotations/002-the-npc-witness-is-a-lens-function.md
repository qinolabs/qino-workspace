**The NPC witness IS a lens function.** The crossing facet says: "Voice before face, relationship before either." The witness's reaction reveals who the arrival is before we see them.

But look at what determines the witness's reaction. In our test case:
- Hale witnessing Cael reads through a recognition lens (both track frequencies → "you hear it too")
- Cael witnessing Hale reads through a revelation lens (upstream content arrives in person → "you're what I've been hearing")

The witness doesn't react to a generic "someone arrived." The witness reads the arrival through the scenario's accumulated lens profile. A converging scenario (Glassmaker's Reach) reads arrivals as potential convergence points. A saturated-scattered scenario (Listening Wall) reads arrivals as potential organizers.

**"Voice before face" is literally the lens reading arriving before the entity does.** The scenario's profile shapes the witness's attention, which shapes the relational texture of the crossing. The witness pattern in crossing.md is, structurally, a lens operation at the relational scale.
