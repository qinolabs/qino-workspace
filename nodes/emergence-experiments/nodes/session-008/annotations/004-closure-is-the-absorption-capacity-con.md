**Closure is the absorption capacity constraint.** It gates what kind of witness a scenario can produce and how much room remains for the arrival to matter.

The trade-off: the crossing facet requires "voice before face" — the witness needs settled meaning to have a perspective worth hearing. But too much closure means the arrival enters a story already written.

| Closure range | Witness quality | Absorption capacity | Crossing character |
|:---:|---|---|---|
| ~0.00 | No witness possible | Total but meaningless | Crossing cannot happen |
| 0.05–0.15 | Thin but genuine | Very high | Arrival reshapes the space |
| 0.30–0.50 | Rich, accumulated | Moderate | Arrival deepens a forming pattern |
| 0.60+ | Deep, nearly complete | Low | Arrival must conform to existing pattern |

Hale → Listening Wall (closure 0.10): Cael witnesses through minimal settled meaning — "you're what I've been hearing" — but the Wall absorbs Hale fully. The arrival can become anything.

Cael → Glassmaker's Reach (closure 0.42): Hale witnesses through rich accumulated understanding — the frequencies, the mentor, the glass. But Cael enters a converging story. Less room to become something unexpected.

**Design implication**: There is a minimum closure threshold for crossing — enough for a witness to exist. And a maximum absorption zone — too much closure and the crossing is merely decorative. Somewhere between 0.05 and 0.50, crossings are most alive.
