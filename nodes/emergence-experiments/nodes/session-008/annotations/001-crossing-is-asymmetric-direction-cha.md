**Crossing is asymmetric — direction changes the kind, not just the fact.** Hale ↔ Cael proximity is 0.78 regardless of direction. But the receiving scenario's profile determines what the arrival means.

**Cael → Glassmaker's Reach** (conv 0.74, sat 0.52, coherence 0.79):
Active metabolism, already converging. The scenario absorbs Cael as the next piece of a forming pattern. Hale as witness: recognition — "you hear it too." **Convergence-accelerating crossing.** The high coherence (0.79) means the scenario can integrate the arrival without fragmenting.

**Hale → Listening Wall** (conv 0.18, sat 0.68, coherence 0.58):
Indigestion, saturated-scattered. Four isolated observers, no organizing principle. The scenario absorbs Hale — "connective, intuitive, makes lateral connections others miss" — as the catalyst it's been missing. Cael as witness: revelation — "you're what I've been hearing." **Fertility-catalyzing crossing.** The low coherence (0.58) means the scenario is hungry for integration.

Same pair, same proximity. Fundamentally different crossings. The proximity lens says *that* they're ready. The intrinsic profile says *what kind of ready*.
