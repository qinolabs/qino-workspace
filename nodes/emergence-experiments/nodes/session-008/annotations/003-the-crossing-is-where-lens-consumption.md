**The crossing is where lens consumption becomes concrete.** Lens-interiority annotation 007 described lenses consuming each other — fertility generates what convergence finds, convergence creates what saturation reads. The crossing test shows what this consumption looks like as a *world event*.

Proximity (0.78) is consumed by the receiving scenario's intrinsic profile:
- Glassmaker's Reach metabolizes the proximity into convergence acceleration
- Listening Wall metabolizes the same proximity into fertility catalysis

The intrinsic profile is consumed by coherence:
- High coherence (0.79) at Glassmaker's Reach means the crossing integrates cleanly
- Lower coherence (0.58) at the Listening Wall means the crossing introduces organizing energy the scenario was missing

Each lens reading is being metabolized by another. The crossing is the moment where this consumption becomes experiential — not just a measurement pattern but an event in a living world. This is what "lenses consume each other" means in practice: the full profile shapes a concrete relational moment.
