**The witness choice is itself a lens selection — one more level of consumption.** The scenario profile constrains the set of possible witnesses. Each witness applies a different lens function to the same arrival.

Cael arriving at Glassmaker's Reach (same proximity, same scenario profile):
- **Hale witnesses**: frequency recognition → convergence crossing ("you hear it too")
- **Seren witnesses**: craft curiosity → cross-modal crossing ("my glass holds light the way your wall holds sound")

Hale arriving at the Listening Wall (same proximity, same scenario profile):
- **Cael witnesses**: downstream revelation → upstream-meets-downstream crossing
- **Petra witnesses**: structural archaeology → origin-tracing crossing
- **Moth witnesses**: territorial challenge → intimacy-vs-expertise crossing

The full consumption chain for a single crossing:

**proximity** (are they ready?) → consumed by **intrinsic profile** (what kind of ready?) → consumed by **coherence** (can it integrate?) → consumed by **closure** (how much room?) → consumed by **witness selection** (whose lens?) → produces **the crossing character**

Each layer metabolizes the previous. No individual lens reading determines the outcome. The crossing is what emerges from the full chain of consumption — the compound meaning that lens-interiority identified as compositionality.
