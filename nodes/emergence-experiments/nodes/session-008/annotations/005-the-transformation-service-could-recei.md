**The transformation service could receive the scenario's lens profile as crossing context.** The crossing facet describes a unified transformation call that produces `worldName + facet + areaId`. Currently this considers the figure's personality, the world's terrain, and the existing social fabric.

The lens profile adds a layer: the scenario's metabolic state constrains what kind of arrival makes sense.

- In a high-convergence scenario (Glassmaker's Reach): transformation should produce a facet that fits the converging pattern — the arrival is drawn into existing threads
- In a high-saturation/low-convergence scenario (Listening Wall): transformation should produce a facet that brings connective potential — the arrival is the missing organizer
- Closure constrains the degree of conformity vs novelty in the facet: high closure → the arrival conforms; low closure → the arrival can be unexpected

This would mean lens readings don't just assess readiness — they actively shape what the crossing produces. The lenses become participants in the world event, not just observers of it.

**Tension**: This could over-determine crossings. Part of the crossing's magic is surprise — the system discovers connections the user didn't plan. If the lens profile constrains too tightly, crossings become predictable. The profile should be context (influencing the transformation prompt), not constraint (hard rules on the output).
