**Session 8 findings bridge to lens-lab product architecture.** The consumption chain (proximity → profile → coherence → closure → witness → crossing character) maps directly onto the assessment service expansion and a new crossing simulation surface.

**Iteration 21 refinements** (already scoped, now informed):
- All 6 lenses are drafted with full prompts and attention focuses — not "to be authored" but "to be seeded"
- Three input shapes are now known: ScenarioSubstrate (4 intrinsic), ScenarioSubstrate + WorldContext (coherence), ProximityContext (proximity)
- World fixture (Tidal Workshop) is ready for integration into the fixtures mode

**Iteration 22 territory** (new scope revealed by the lab):
1. Profile view — compound display of all lenses against a scenario, showing the composite meaning
2. Entity-pair assessment path — `assessEntityPair()` alongside existing `assess()`
3. Crossing simulation — select pair, see profiles, choose direction and witness, predict crossing character
4. World-level fixture integration in assessment router

**The architectural insight**: lenses aren't separate from the world. Assessment measures what transformation uses. Transformation produces crossings that change what assessment measures next. The product should expect this feedback loop, not treat assessment as a one-way pipeline.
