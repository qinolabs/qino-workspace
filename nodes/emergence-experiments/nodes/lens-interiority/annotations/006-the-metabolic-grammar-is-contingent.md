**The metabolic grammar is contingent — keep it as one instrument, not the instrument.**

The metabolic ratios (conversion, digestion) remain useful. They discriminate states, they hold at two scales, they produce the fractal finding. But they are one syntax among at least three viable alternatives (resonance, tension field, compositional). 

Risks if the metabolic frame hardens into the only frame:
- It privileges irreversibility (consumption is one-way), which may not hold for all lens relationships
- It imports normative assumptions (indigestion = pathology, active metabolism = health) that may not belong
- It measures only 2 of 15 possible lens-pair relationships, treating the other 13 as invisible
- It erases qualitative differences in how lenses engage (reservation 1 from the first tension annotation)

The relational lenses (coherence, proximity) are absent from all current grammars. When they enter the picture, they may require a grammar the metabolic frame can't provide — or they may reveal that the metabolic frame was one special case of something more general.

**Working position**: hold the metabolic grammar as *the first grammar discovered*, not as the grammar. Keep it operational (the ratios produce useful readings). But remain open to the possibility that the compositional finding — lens readings compose — is the real structure, and any particular grammar is a reading of that structure.
