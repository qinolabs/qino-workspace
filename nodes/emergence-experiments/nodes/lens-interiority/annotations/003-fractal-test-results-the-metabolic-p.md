**Fractal test results — the metabolic pattern holds at two scales.**

Ran all four intrinsic lenses against the three Tidal Workshop scenarios. The metabolic states map to the standalone fixture states:

| Scenario | Conv | Sat | Fert | Closure | Conversion | Digestion | State | Standalone Mirror |
|----------|:----:|:---:|:----:|:-------:|:----------:|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
| Silt Garden | 0.15 | 0.18 | 0.62 | 0.05 | 0.19 | 0.28 | Germinating | Gathering Threads |
| Glassmaker's Reach | 0.74 | 0.52 | 0.35 | 0.42 | 0.68 | 0.81 | Active metabolism | Same Shore |
| Listening Wall | 0.18 | 0.68 | 0.52 | 0.10 | 0.26 | 0.15 | Indigestion | Full Market |

**At world level**, treating scenarios as lens functions for the world:
- Silt Garden = world's fertility (0.62)
- Glassmaker's Reach = world's convergence (0.74)
- Listening Wall = world's saturation (0.68)
- Closure = absent (no scenario where tension resolves)

World conversion ratio: 0.54 (mid-process — fertility being consumed by convergence)
World digestion ratio: ~0.00 (no closure in the system)

The world is in a new metabolic state: **converting but not digesting**. Direction is forming but nothing has been resolved. This is distinct from both "indigestion" (no conversion either) and "active metabolism" (digestion keeping pace with accumulation).
