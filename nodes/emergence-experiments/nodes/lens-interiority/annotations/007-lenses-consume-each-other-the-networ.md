**Lenses consume each other — the network is alive, not static.** The "graph of lenses" framing implies nodes and edges — a fixed topology. But the fractal test revealed something different: lenses don't just measure, they metabolize each other's outputs.

Fertility generates what convergence will later find. Convergence creates the density that saturation reads. Closure transforms the space that fertility sees next. Each lens operates on a substrate that other lenses have already shaped.

This is why the fractal pattern works across scales: at scenario level, the lenses read a substrate. At world level, the scenarios *become* lens functions — Silt Garden *is* fertility, Glassmaker's Reach *is* convergence. The consumption happens at every scale.

The correct framing is not a graph but a **digestive cycle** — or more precisely, a system where the distinction between "lens" and "substrate" dissolves at certain scales. What measures at one level becomes what is measured at the next. The interiority is this: lenses don't have fixed identities. They are roles in a metabolic process.
