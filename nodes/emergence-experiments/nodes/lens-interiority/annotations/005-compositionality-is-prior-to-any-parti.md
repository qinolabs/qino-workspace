**Compositionality is prior to any particular grammar.**

The metabolic frame (conversion ratio, digestion ratio) was the first grammar that fit the data. It emerged from noticing fertility decline as convergence increases, and calling that "consumption." But the choice to ratio those particular lens-pairs, and the choice to call their relationship metabolic, is itself a lens with its own attention focus.

Three alternative grammars read the same data differently:

**Resonance**: Lenses don't consume — they resonate or interfere. Convergence and saturation in phase (Threshold Garden) = constructive. Out of phase (Full Market) = destructive. The instrument measures phase relationships, not conversion.

**Tension field**: Each lens creates a force — fertility expands, convergence contracts, saturation pressurizes, closure resolves. A scenario's state is a vector sum. The Full Market isn't "indigestion" — it's a pressure system with no outlet. The instrument measures net force and direction.

**Compositional**: Each lens reading is a morpheme. The profile is a sentence. "High convergence + high saturation + low closure" says "directed accumulation without resolution." The metabolic ratios are one syntax. Other syntaxes exist. The grammar isn't the ratios — it's the deeper structure that lets lens readings compose into compound meanings at all.

**What's prior to all of these**: the bare fact that lens readings *compose into something*. The Full Market's profile means something that none of its individual signals mean. That compositionality is the discovery. The grammar is how you read it.

The fractal goes one level deeper here: lenses read substrate. Meta-lenses (grammars) read lens relationships. The choice of grammar is itself a lens operation. The interiority isn't in any particular grammar — it's in the fact that the system generates readings of its own readings.
