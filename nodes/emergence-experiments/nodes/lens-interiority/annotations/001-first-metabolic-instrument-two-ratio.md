**First metabolic instrument — two ratios derived from existing calibration data.**

**Conversion ratio** = `convergence / (fertility + convergence)` — how much potential has become direction.
**Digestion ratio** = `closure / saturation` — how much accumulated material has been metabolized.

| Fixture | Stage | Conv | Sat | Fert | Closure | Conversion | Digestion | Metabolic State |
|---------|-------|:----:|:---:|:----:|:-------:|:----------:|:---------:|-----------------|
| Empty Room | cold | 0.03 | 0.04 | 0.06 | 0.00 | 0.33 | 0.00 | Dormant |
| Gathering Threads | early | 0.12 | 0.14 | 0.58 | 0.08 | 0.17 | 0.57 | Germinating |
| Same Shore | converging | 0.72 | 0.48 | 0.38 | 0.48 | 0.65 | 1.00 | Active metabolism |
| Full Market | saturated | 0.13 | 0.73 | 0.45 | 0.12 | 0.22 | 0.16 | Indigestion |
| Threshold Garden | near-ready | 0.88 | 0.79 | 0.22 | 0.68 | 0.80 | 0.86 | Near-completion |

The metabolic state names come from reading the *relationships between signals*, not individual signals. "Indigestion" requires seeing saturation high AND closure low AND conversion stalled simultaneously.

**Conservation test**: `fertility + convergence` is NOT constant across the lifecycle (0.70 → 1.10 → 0.58 → 1.10). The metabolism is fed by ongoing encounter — an open system, not a closed one. Energy enters through inquiry and is converted through engagement.
