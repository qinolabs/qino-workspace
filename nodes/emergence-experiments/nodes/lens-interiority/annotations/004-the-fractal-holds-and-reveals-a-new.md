**The fractal holds — and reveals a new metabolic state the scenario-level instrument couldn't name.**

At scenario level, five metabolic states emerged: dormant, germinating, active metabolism, indigestion, near-completion. These came from the 5 standalone fixtures.

At world level, the Tidal Workshop occupies a *sixth* state: **converting but not digesting**. Conversion ratio 0.54 (fertility being consumed by convergence — the Glassmaker's Reach is actively converting potential into direction). Digestion ratio ~0.00 (no closure scenario exists — nothing in the world has been resolved).

This state is invisible at scenario level because no single scenario has this profile. It emerges only when you read the world as a metabolic system where scenarios function as lens readings. The Silt Garden doesn't know it's the world's fertility. The Glassmaker's Reach doesn't know it's the world's convergence. But the world-level metabolism is real — it describes a system that's mid-process, forming direction without having resolved anything yet.

**What this means for the fractal claim**: the same ratios (conversion, digestion) produce meaningful readings at both scales. But each scale can produce states the other scale can't. The fractal isn't just repetition — it's the same grammar generating different sentences at different scales. The vocabulary is shared; the expressions are scale-specific.

**What the world-level reading says the Tidal Workshop needs**: a closure event. Not a new scenario — a resolution within an existing one, or a crossing between scenarios that produces resolution. The world has direction (Glassmaker's Reach) and mass (Listening Wall) but no digestion. Something needs to be held long enough to settle.
