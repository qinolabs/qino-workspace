**What the metabolic ratios flatten — reservations about the first instrument.**

**1. Ratios erase quality.** Digestion ratio 1.00 (Same Shore) says "everything accumulated is being engaged" — but it doesn't say *how*. Dhar's "maybe it's the other way around" is a qualitatively different kind of engagement than three voices restating the same observation. The ratio treats all closure equally. Real metabolism has different qualities of digestion — absorption vs. fermentation vs. passing through. The narrative field in each lens assessment carries this quality, but the ratio discards it.

**2. The lifecycle ordering is assumed, not derived.** The metabolic states (dormant → germinating → active → near-completion) were read against an assumed progression. But the Full Market's "indigestion" breaks the line — it's not a lifecycle stage, it's a pathological state. The instrument should be able to detect pathology without assuming a healthy trajectory. Currently the state names come from comparing against a mental model of "how it should go," which is exactly the kind of external framework the interiority framing wants to avoid.

**3. Two ratios can't capture the fractal.** The user sensed fractal structure — the same pattern operating at every scale. Two ratios describe one scale (scenario-level lens relationships). They say nothing about whether the same metabolism operates at world level (between scenarios), at entity-pair level (proximity consuming coherence?), or at the meta level (between the ratios themselves). The fractal claim needs instruments at multiple scales, not just one.

**4. The ratios are symmetrical but the metabolism may not be.** `conversion = convergence / (fertility + convergence)` treats fertility→convergence as a simple transfer. But the data suggests it's not symmetric — convergence doesn't convert back to fertility. The instrument treats both directions as equivalent when the actual metabolism may be irreversible. Irreversibility might be structurally important (it's what makes it a lifecycle rather than an oscillation).

**5. Relational lenses are absent.** These ratios use only the four intrinsic lenses. Coherence and proximity — the relational lenses — aren't in the picture yet. If the metabolism is really about how lenses consume each other, the relational lenses may be consuming or being consumed by the intrinsic ones in ways we can't see from this table alone. The Tidal Workshop data could test this: does a scenario's coherence signal metabolize differently depending on its intrinsic profile?

**6. "Indigestion" might be the most interesting state, not a failure.** The metabolic framing risks treating the Full Market as broken — high saturation, low digestion, metabolically "stuck." But the Full Market's fertility is 0.45 — significant latent connections exist. Maybe indigestion isn't pathology but *a different kind of aliveness* — a system that's accumulating toward a phase transition that the current lenses can't predict. The metabolic frame might be importing assumptions about health and disease that don't belong here.
