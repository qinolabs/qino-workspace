Something is emerging through the way lenses relate to each other — not as a static graph, but as a living system with internal movement. The lenses consume each other: fertility converts into convergence and saturation. Closure metabolizes saturation into readiness. The grammar isn't imposed on the material; it's the same grammar the material uses to organize itself.

Two journal entries sparked this thread:

**Session 5**: *"i feel something is emerging through the way lenses themselves are related to each other. they begin to remind me of a grammar that can possibly express an answer to a question formed by user experience, immanence of the ui, coherence of the world, vitality of the game experience. a graph of lenses: it feels like a multi-dimensional shaping tool for a multi-dimensional art work"*

**Session 6**: *"this reaffirms my hunch that the relationship of lenses themselves could be the pattern that matters for certain use cases more than an individual lens. i don't know what that means exactly yet, but i think we can discover something if we simulate and talk through some concrete examples"*

The correction: "graph of lenses" may not be right unless the graph is alive. What's sensed is an interiority — lenses in the group consuming each other and creating a fractal pattern. The same shape (accumulate → transform → emerge) that lenses observe in scenarios is also the shape the lenses enact among themselves. Can this be grounded through simulation, or does it need to remain a sensing instrument?
