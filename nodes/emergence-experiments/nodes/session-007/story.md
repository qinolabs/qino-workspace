The final lens in the 6-lens taxonomy. Proximity is the most architecturally distinct lens — it operates on entity-pair substrate rather than scenario-level substrate. It asks: when do two entities have enough relational density to support a crossing or deepened connection?

This session discovers the input shape (EntityPairContext), drafts the lens, and calibrates it against entity pairs from the Tidal Workshop at varying relational distances.

Sparked by Session 6 (closure): with all intrinsic lenses (convergence, saturation, fertility, closure) and one relational lens (coherence) drafted, proximity completes the set.
