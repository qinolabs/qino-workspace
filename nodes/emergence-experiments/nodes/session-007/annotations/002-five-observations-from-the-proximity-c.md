**Five observations from the proximity calibration.**

1. **Proximity doesn't require co-presence.** Hale ↔ Cael scores 0.78 despite being in different scenarios. They share a phenomenal domain (frequency/sound) and the river carries one's material to the other. Proximity can be higher cross-scenario than some same-scenario pairs.

2. **Knowledge complementarity is the strongest driver.** Every high-scoring pair features complementary knowledge — different keys to the same mystery. Seren↔Hale (visual memory vs acoustic frequency), Hale↔Cael (upstream tracking vs downstream reception), Moth↔Petra (experiential vs archaeological). When one entity holds something the other needs, proximity is high.

3. **Structural connection without experiential substrate caps proximity.** Ondra↔Seren and Petra↔Seren both have genuine material connections through tidal minerals, but score mid-range (0.45, 0.38) because neither entity is seeking the other. The connection is real but dormant.

4. **Temperamental compatibility is necessary but insufficient.** Ondra and Seren share deep temperamental resonance (patience, observation, material attentiveness) but score only 0.45 because their concerns don't overlap. Temperature alone doesn't produce proximity.

5. **Latent proximity is a distinct state.** Hale↔Cael (0.78) is structurally close but experientially invisible — neither knows the other exists, yet the river has been carrying Hale's frequencies to Cael's wall. This parallels the Listening Wall's "latent coherence" from Session 4 (0.58). Both coherence and proximity exhibit latent states.
