**Proximity completes a three-lens relational picture — and reveals a pattern across all lenses.**

The 6-lens taxonomy is now fully drafted:
- **4 intrinsic** (convergence, saturation, fertility, closure) — assess scenario substrate
- **2 relational** (coherence, proximity) — assess relationships beyond the scenario

But proximity revealed something deeper: **every relational lens has a latent state.**
- Coherence: The Listening Wall (0.58) — structurally aligned with the world but experientially invisible
- Proximity: Hale↔Cael (0.78) — deeply complementary but neither knows the other exists

Latent states aren't low states. Low coherence is *contradiction* (The Full Market, 0.32). Low proximity is *absence* (Moth↔Ondra, 0.15). Latent states are *concealed presence* — the substrate is there but hasn't surfaced into experience.

This has design implications: the system should distinguish "not ready" from "ready but hidden." A low signal means "don't try." A latent signal means "the ground exists — the connection needs an occasion to surface, not more substrate."

**Cross-reference**: This maps to the crossing principle from qino-world — "voice before face, relationship before either." Latent proximity means the relationship exists (in shared material, shared concerns) but hasn't yet become voice. The crossing occasion is what makes it audible.
