**The world fixture design mirrors the emergence pattern itself.** The Tidal Workshop has its own accumulate → assess → emerge structure:

- **Accumulation**: materials flow downstream, each scenario accumulates substrate from the same geological source
- **Assessment**: the coherence lens asks whether emergence in one scenario fits the world that contains the others
- **Emergence**: if The Glassmaker's Reach reaches readiness, the emergence (sand-memory becoming conscious) would ripple through — Ondra's root patterns would make sense, the Listening Wall's mineral veins would connect

The world isn't just a test container. It's a miniature ecosystem where emergence in one scenario changes what "readiness" means in the others. This is the inter-scenario coupling the terrain document describes but that standalone fixtures can't represent.
