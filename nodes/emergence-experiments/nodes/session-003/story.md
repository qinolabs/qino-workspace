Designing a world-level fixture for testing relational lenses (coherence, closure, proximity). The existing 5 fixtures are standalone scenarios — they work for intrinsic lenses (convergence, saturation, fertility) but can't test lenses that need context beyond the immediate substrate.

**Design constraints**:
- 3 scenarios in a single world with clear character
- Real inter-scenario threads (shared entities, material flows, echoing themes)
- At least one scenario with productive tension against the world fabric
- Enough world history for coherence assessment
- Substrate detailed enough for ALL lenses to be run against each scenario
