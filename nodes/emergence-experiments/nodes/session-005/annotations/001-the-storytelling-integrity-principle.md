**The Storytelling Integrity Principle** — what characters can and cannot know:

Characters speak from **local experience**. They notice what's in front of them. They remember what they've personally encountered. A traveling instrument maker might recognize a frequency he heard downstream. A gardener notices her silt changed. An archaeologist reads construction techniques. These are all experiential — grounded in what the character's senses and skills give them access to.

Characters do NOT:
- Name locations they haven't visited in the context of a structural claim
- Announce the world's design through dialogue ("same source, different expressions")
- Have system-level awareness of how scenarios relate to each other
- Serve as mouthpieces for the world-builder's knowledge

**The coherence lens must be the reader, not the characters.** The lens sees both the scenario's substrate AND the world context. It detects that Hale's "frequency in a stone downstream" and Petra's "same mineral signature across centuries" might describe the same geological source — but neither character makes that connection. The connection lives in the *space between* their observations, and the lens is what reads that space.

**Revisions made**:
- Hale on Tidal Minerals: removed omniscient three-location naming → experiential frequency-chasing with one downstream reference
- Hale on Resonant Glass: removed system-mapping language ("the river connects them — carrying a frequency from here to there") → personal discovery ("I kept it because it hummed. Now I know why — it came from here.")
