**The storytelling integrity principle connects back to the qino-world design constraints** from the navigator terrain:

| World Constraint | Storytelling Principle |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "Pull mechanics — accumulation means something because you accumulated it" | Connections mean something because you discovered them, not because a character announced them |
| "The world is encountered, not authored" | The substrate is encountered by the lens, not authored for it |
| "No staged dialogue — ticks produce traces, not conversations between figures" | Inquiries produce local observations, not system-level claims |
| "Voice before face, relationship before either" | The connection exists before anyone names it — naming comes later, if at all |

The coherence lens as a *careful reader* is structurally the same as the world principle that meaning is encountered, not placed. The lens doesn't create coherence — it makes existing coherence perceivable, just like a convergence lens doesn't add convergence. The revised Hale inquiries honor this: the substrate contains the connection (frequency, material flow, timing), but the connection is *read*, not *announced*.
