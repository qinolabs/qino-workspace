**Coherence v2 re-assessment of The Glassmaker's Reach: 0.79** (down from 0.92).

The 13-point drop is exactly right. The lens still detects the inter-scenario connections — Hale's downstream stone / Silt Garden's changed silt, Vanished Mentor / Wall Builder's upriver masonry — but through inference rather than explicit statement. The evidence is weaker, the gaps are acknowledged, and the narrative reflects that coherence is "emergent, not stated."

This is how it should work in real play. The connections EXIST in the substrate (downstream stone, upriver craftsperson, timing of changes) but must be READ by the lens. The 0.79 signal says: "this fits, and there are suggestive connections, but they haven't been confirmed." That's more honest and more useful than 0.92 was.

**Comparison**:
- v1 (explicit Hale): 0.92 — "Hale says it, so it's true"
- v2 (inferential): 0.79 — "the lens detects parallels that could be connections"

The 0.79 also leaves room for the score to INCREASE as inquiry deepens the connections — if someone at the Silt Garden analyzes what the roots are reaching for and finds the same mineral, or if the Vanished Mentor awakens and reveals a link to the wall, the coherence signal should rise. The score reflects current evidence, not potential.
