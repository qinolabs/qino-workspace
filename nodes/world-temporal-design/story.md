How worlds breathe through cyclical rhythms, how awakening surfaces through the world's own fabric, and how scenarios progress through accumulated temporal logic -- three design spaces that form one system through the world's relationship with time.

**Territory**: Temporal texture (cycles, universal time unit, tick-to-real-time mapping) + awakening surfaces (what the user experiences when manifestations, areas, and worlds awaken) + scenario progression (what triggers transitions, interlude resolution) + the pilgrimage pattern (stories become substrate for intentional presence)
**Since**: 2026-02-16

**What sparked this**: Concept work on the temporal-texture facet revealed that three previously separate design questions -- how worlds have their own time, how awakening feels to the user, and what drives scenario transitions -- are actually one interconnected system. Cycles provide the micro-texture. Awakening uses cycles for staging. Scenario transitions are the macro heartbeat. The interlude resolves accumulated state. The connecting pattern: small awakenings mid-scenario at the right cycle moment, medium awakenings at scenario boundaries, large awakenings across multiple scenarios.

**The crystallizing insight**: "Imagine what experiences this enables -- the user hears a story about a place, goes there at the right time, and the moment recognizes their intentional presence." This is the pilgrimage pattern: stories the user carries become substrate the moment they act on them. The world's temporal logic provides the clock; the user's curiosity provides the direction; the convergence is where meaning lives.

**Sibling navigators**: `dialogue-quality` owns the prompt pipeline and model economics. `lens-ecosystem` owns how sensitivity reaches modalities. This navigator owns how worlds *live in time* -- the temporal grammar that makes awakening feel organic, scenarios feel like chapters, and presence feel like it matters.
