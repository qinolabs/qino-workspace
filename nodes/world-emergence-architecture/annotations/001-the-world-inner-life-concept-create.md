The **world-inner-life** concept (created in qino-concepts today) extends Gap 2 (the feedback loop) into a new dimension. The navigator originally mapped the loop as: storage → context → LLM input → LLM output → detection → storage. World inner life adds an autonomous branch: substrate → world process (independent of user session) → manifestation emotional state + ambient chatter → new substrate.

This is not just "feeding substrate back into prompts" — it's the world metabolizing substrate on its own schedule. Three expressions identified:
- **Ambient chatter** (manifestation rail comes alive with overheard conversation)
- **Manifestation emotional state** (atmospheric shifts from world processing)
- **Pocket participation** (mobile notifications with choices that affect the world)

The navigator's convergent tracks evolve: Track A (substrate scope) becomes even more foundational — autonomous world processing needs scenario-level substrate. Track B (ceremony) is complete (iteration 27). Track C (seeds) is complete but the relational map visibility tiers (`open`/`hidden`/`latent`) now also govern what the autonomous world process can surface.

A new track emerges: **Track D — World autonomy.** The autonomous processing layer, manifestation emotional state, and the feedback from world process back into dialogue context.
