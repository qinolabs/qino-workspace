How the substrate system evolves from a session-local observation system into a world-level emergence engine. Maps the terrain between what's built (mention detection, substrate accumulation, awakening pipeline) and what's needed (scenario-scoped accumulation, latent seed injection, generative context composition, the ceremony experience, area and world awakening).

Three structural gaps define the territory:

1. **Substrate scope** — accumulation is session-bound. The emergence loop needs scenario-level or world-level persistence. How does substrate survive across sessions without losing the contextual richness of where each perspective came from?

2. **The feedback loop** — the pipeline runs one way (LLM output → detection → storage). Emergence needs it to run both ways (storage → context → LLM input → LLM output → detection → storage). The latent seed concept — things not yet on the field that the LLM can reach for — has no infrastructure yet.

3. **Emergence types beyond manifestation** — the schema supports person/place/artifact/faction/planet mentions. Area awakening, world awakening, and relational threading each need their own accumulation logic built on top of the existing substrate foundation.

The navigator also carries two new concept nodes that frame the design space:
- **emergence-payoff-loop** — the experience layer: what players feel when emergence works (six concrete examples mapped)
- **generative-context-design** — the enabling layer: seed authoring, context composition, prompt shaping, detection & feedback

The discipline we're developing: managing and curating seeds for creative constraints. As authors of this system, the conditions we create for the LLM to move are our instrument for shaping the experience.
