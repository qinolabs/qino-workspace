How lens technology crosses from infrastructure into living modality experience — Journey as nervous system routing sensitivity, modalities as organs generating their own content, Lens Lab as laboratory surface.

**Territory**: Journey voicing infrastructure + modality integration patterns (World, Walk) + Lens Lab calibration + lens concept architecture
**Since**: 2026-02-09

**What sparked this**: Building Infra 09 (Ecosystem Calibration) and running two validation builds that revealed the nervous system boundary. Walk forced its data into Journey's substrate shape — proving the runtime API conflated ecosystem-level and modality-local operations. The boundary sharpened the metaphor: Journey carries sensitivity, organs generate experience.

**Key evolution (2026-02-10)**: The Infra 09 runtime API surface was removed entirely — zero consumers across all modalities. The nervous system metaphor survived but the implementation model flipped: Journey operates through **calibration propagation** (lens versions → cache invalidation → different perception), not runtime API calls. The calibration vocabulary remains (`SlotType`, `selectLens` cascade, `LensContext` extensions).

**Sibling**: `emergence-experiments` — that navigator maps what emerges (readiness, awakening, accumulation mechanics). This one maps how sensitivity reaches the organs (lens integration, calibration propagation, the grammar that adapts vocabulary across modalities).

**The open frontier**: The vocabulary is built (24 lenses, 8 slot types, calibration via version-based cache invalidation). The working pipeline (`voiceFigureWithData`, `selectLens` cascade) handles crossing voicing. Open questions center on whether modalities need a metadata API for lens-aware local generation, or whether the existing `getLenses` + prompt-building is sufficient. Two tracks:
1. **Deepen what works** — World 23 (inline crossing), Walk 16 phases 4-5 (planning layer)
2. **Expand the laboratory** — Lens Lab 23 (relational lenses, world fixtures, crossing simulation)
