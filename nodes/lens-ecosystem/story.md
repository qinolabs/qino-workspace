How lens technology crosses from infrastructure into living modality experience — Journey as nervous system routing sensitivity, modalities as organs generating their own content, Lens Lab as laboratory surface.

**Territory**: Journey voicing infrastructure + modality integration patterns (World, Walk) + Lens Lab calibration + lens concept architecture
**Since**: 2026-02-09

**What sparked this**: Building Infra 09 (Ecosystem Calibration) and running two validation builds that revealed the nervous system boundary. Walk forced its data into Journey's substrate shape — proving `voiceForSlot` conflates ecosystem-level and modality-local operations. The boundary sharpened the metaphor: Journey carries sensitivity, organs generate experience.

**Sibling**: `emergence-experiments` — that navigator maps what emerges (readiness, awakening, accumulation mechanics). This one maps how sensitivity reaches the organs (lens integration, dialect, the grammar that adapts vocabulary across modalities).

**The open frontier**: The vocabulary is built (24 lenses, 8 slot types, attention adaptations, slot-aware caching). What's missing is the grammar — specifically, a lens intelligence API where modalities ask Journey for metadata (which lens, what adaptations, facet references) without Journey generating content. Three tracks converge toward it:
1. **Deepen what works** — World 23 (inline crossing), Walk 16 phases 4-5 (planning layer)
2. **Expand the laboratory** — Lens Lab 23 (relational lenses, world fixtures, crossing simulation)
3. **Build the lens intelligence pathway** — Infra 10: `getLensContext` as metadata-only RPC
