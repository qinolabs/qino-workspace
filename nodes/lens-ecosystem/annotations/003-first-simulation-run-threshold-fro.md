## First Simulation Run: Threshold / Frontier Station / "The Quiet Watch"

**Date**: 2026-02-15
**Deck**: threshold (frontier-station, scenario 0)
**Turns**: 6 per profile

### Mention Extraction by Profile

| Profile | Total Mentions | Per Turn |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Curious Explorer | 8 | 1.33 |
| Lore Seeker | 7 | 1.17 |
| Relationship Builder | 5 | 0.83 |
| Speedrunner | 4 | 0.67 |

### Lens Signals (Unencountered Substrate)

All profiles produced identical lens readings (expected — v1 doesn't accumulate mention substrate):
- Convergence: 0.70 — Strong thematic convergence (preservation/memory) but no interpersonal links
- Saturation: 0.30 — 3 figures with clear roles, isolated from each other
- Fertility: **0.80** — Rich potential: Keeper + Archivist complementary pair, overdue shipment connects all three
- Closure: 0.15 — Central tension acknowledged but unspoken

### Key Observations

1. **Mention extraction scales with engagement depth**: 2x differential between Explorer and Speedrunner. The system responds differently to different engagement styles even at the dialogue level.

2. **Threshold deck has strong fertility at unencountered state**: 0.80 fertility with 0.15 closure = lots of threads, nothing resolved. Good design for early engagement.

3. **The Keeper produces the most mentions**: Across all profiles, The Keeper's responses referenced other figures and station elements most frequently. The "bartender who knows everything" archetype is a natural mention generator.

4. **Lens signals don't differentiate between profiles yet**: Expected for v1 (no mention substrate accumulation). The differential signal lives in raw mention counts, not lens readings. V2 (relational inquiry simulation) would change this.
