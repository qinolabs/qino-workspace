## Cross-Deck Finding: Manifestation Count vs Mention Depth

**Date**: 2026-02-15
**Profile**: Curious Explorer (6 turns each)

### Threshold (3 manifestations) vs Observatory (6 manifestations)

| Metric | Threshold | Observatory |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Mentions/turn | 1.33 | 0.83 |
| Saturation | 0.30 | 0.65 |
| Fertility | 0.80 | 0.85 |
| Closure | 0.15 | 0.30 |

### Design Insight

Fewer manifestations per scenario produces **deeper substrate per figure** (more turns per character = richer conversation history = more mentions). More manifestations produce **broader but shallower substrate** (higher saturation, more community fabric, but less depth per figure).

This is a fundamental deck design trade-off: depth vs breadth. The round-robin turn allocation means N manifestations in T turns gives each figure T/N turns. Threshold's 3 figures get 2 turns each; Observatory's 6 get 1 each.

**Implication for deck design**: Scenarios optimized for early awakening should have fewer manifestations (3-4). Scenarios optimized for world-building richness should have more (5-6). This could become a design guideline.
